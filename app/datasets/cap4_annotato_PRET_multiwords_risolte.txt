<chapter>﻿<chapterTitle><strong>4. <concept>NETWORK</concept>ING AND THE <concept>INTERNET</concept></strong></chapterTitle></br></br><sentence>The need to share information and resources among different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s has led to linked <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept>s, called <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, in which <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are connected so that data can be transferred from <concept>MACHINE</concept> to <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In these <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>COMPUTER</concept> users can exchange <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s and share resources—such as printing capabilities, <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> packages, and data storage facilities—that are scattered throughout the system.</sentence> <sentence>The underlying <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of <concept>NETWORK SOFTWARE</concept> that provides a sophisticated <concept>NETWORK</concept>-wide infrastructure.</sentence> <sentence>In a sense, <concept>NETWORK SOFTWARE</concept> is evolving into a <concept>NETWORK</concept>-wide <concept>OPERATING SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this chapter we will explore this expanding field of <concept>COMPUTER</concept> science.</sentence></br></br><section><sectionTitle><strong>4.1 <concept>NETWORK</concept> fundamentals</strong></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence>We begin our study of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s by introducing a variety of basic <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing concepts.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>NETWORK</concept> classifications</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>A <concept>COMPUTER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept> is often classified as being either a <concept>PERSONAL AREA NETWORK</concept> (pan), a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept> (lan), a <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept> (man), or a <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept> (wan).</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>PERSONAL AREA NETWORK</concept> is normally used for shortrange communications—typically less than a few meters—such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its pc.</sentence> <sentence>In contrast, a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept> normally consists of a collection of <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a single building or building complex.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept> is a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, a <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept> links <concept>MACHINE</concept>s over a greater distance—perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.</sentence> <sentence>Another means of classifying <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is based on whether the <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>NETWORK</concept> of the former type is called an <concept>OPEN NETWORK</concept>; a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence><concept>OPEN NETWORK</concept> designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>INTERNET</concept> (a popular worldwide <concept>NETWORK</concept> of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s that we will study in this chapter) is an <concept>OPEN SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In particular, communication throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is governed by an open collection of standards known as the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite, which is the subject of section 4.4.</sentence> <sentence>Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.</sentence> <sentence>In contrast, a company such as novell inc.</sentence> <sentence>Might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing these products.</sentence> <sentence>Still another way of classifying <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is based on the topology of the <concept>NETWORK</concept>, which refers to the pattern in which the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are connected.</sentence> <sentence>Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1a), and the star, in which one <concept>MACHINE</concept> serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1b).</sentence> <sentence>The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as ethernet, and <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>s remain one of the most popular <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing systems in use today.</sentence> <sentence>The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.</sentence> <sentence>It evolved from the paradigm of a large central <concept>COMPUTER</concept> serving many users.</sentence> <sentence>As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s themselves, a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> emerged.</sentence> <sentence>Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless <concept>NETWORK</concept>s where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central <concept>MACHINE</concept>, called the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> (ap), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.</sentence> <sentence>The difference between a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> and a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.</sentence> <sentence>The distinction is whether the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept> envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> might not appear as a long bus from which <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are connected over short links as depicted in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1.</sentence> <sentence>Instead, it may have a very <concept>SHORT BUS</concept> with long links to the individual <concept>MACHINE</concept>s, meaning that the <concept>NETWORK</concept> would look more like a star.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, sometimes a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> is created by running links from each <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.</sentence> <sentence>This hub is little more than a very <concept>SHORT BUS</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>All it does is relay any signal it receives (with perhaps some amplification) back out to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s connected to it.</sentence> <sentence>The result is a <concept>NETWORK</concept> that looks like a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> although it operates like a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Protocols for a <concept>NETWORK</concept> to function reliably, it is important to establish rules by which activities are conducted.</sentence> <sentence>Such rules are called protocols.</sentence> <sentence>By developing and adopting protocol standards, vendors are able to build products for <concept>NETWORK</concept> applications that are compatible with products from other vendors.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing technologies.</sentence> <sentence>As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s among <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Without rules governing this communication, all the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s might insist on transmitting <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s at the same time or fail to assist other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s when that assistance is required.</sentence> <sentence>In a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> based on the ethernet standards, the right to transmit <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s is controlled by the protocol known as <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, <concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept> (csma/cd).</sentence> <sentence>This protocol dictates that each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> be broadcast to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s on the bus (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.2).</sentence> <sentence>Each <concept>MACHINE</concept> monitors all the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s but keeps only those addressed to itself.</sentence> <sentence>To transmit a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>, a <concept>MACHINE</concept> waits until the bus is silent, and at this time it begins transmitting while continuing to monitor the bus.</sentence> <sentence>If another <concept>MACHINE</concept> also begins transmitting, both <concept>MACHINE</concept>s detect the clash and pause for a brief, independently random period of time before trying to transmit again.</sentence> <sentence>The result is a system similar to that used by a small group of people in a conversation.</sentence> <sentence>If two people start to talk at once, they both stop.</sentence> <sentence>The difference is that people might go through a series such as, “i’m sorry, what were you going to say?”, “no, no.</sentence> <sentence>You go first,” whereas under the <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€ protocol each <concept>MACHINE</concept> merely tries again later.</sentence> <sentence>Note that <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€ is not compatible with wireless <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept>s in which all <concept>MACHINE</concept>s communicate through a <concept>CENTRAL ACCESS POINT</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This is because a <concept>MACHINE</concept> may be unable to detect that its transmissions are colliding with those of another.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Another cause might be that the signals from the different <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the <concept>CENTRAL ACCESS POINT</concept> (a condition known as the <concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM</concept>, <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.3).</sentence> <sentence>The result is that wireless <concept>NETWORK</concept>s adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.</sentence> <sentence>Such policies are classified as <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept></concept>#€ (csma/ca), many of which are standardized by ieee (see the sidebar “institute of electrical and electronics engineers” in chapter 7) within the protocols defined in ieee 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.</sentence> <sentence>We emphasize that <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept> protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.</sentence> <sentence>When collisions do occur, <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s must be retransmitted.</sentence> <sentence>The most common approach to <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept> is based on giving advantage to <concept>MACHINE</concept>s that have already been waiting for an opportunity to transmit.</sentence> <sentence>The protocol used is similar to ethernet’s <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€.</sentence> <sentence>The basic difference is that when a <concept>MACHINE</concept> first needs to transmit a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and finds the communication channel silent, it does not start transmitting immediately.</sentence> <sentence>Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only if the channel has remained silent throughout that period.</sentence> <sentence>If a <concept>BUSY CHANNEL</concept> is experienced during this process, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.</sentence> <sentence>Once this period is exhausted, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> is allowed to claim a <concept>SILENT CHANNEL</concept> without hesitation.</sentence> <sentence>This means that collisions between “newcomers” and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a “newcomer” is not allowed to claim a <concept>SILENT CHANNEL</concept> until any <concept>MACHINE</concept> that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.</sentence> <sentence>This protocol, however, does not solve the <concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or <concept>BUSY CHANNEL</concept> requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.</sentence> <sentence>To solve this problem, some <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s require that each <concept>MACHINE</concept> send a short “request” <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and wait until the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>If the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> is busy because it is dealing with a “<concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL</concept>,” it will ignore the request, and the requesting <concept>MACHINE</concept> will know to wait.</sentence> <sentence>Otherwise, the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> will acknowledge the request, and the <concept>MACHINE</concept> will know that it is safe to transmit.</sentence> <sentence>Note that all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept> will hear all acknowledgments sent from the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and thus have a good idea of whether the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> is busy at any given time, even though they may not be able to hear the transmissions taking place.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Combining <concept>NETWORK</concept>s</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>Sometimes it is necessary to connect existing <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form an extended communication system.</sentence> <sentence>This can be done by connecting the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form a larger version of the same “type” of <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in the case of <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept>s based on the ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.</sentence> <sentence>This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.</sentence> <sentence>The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.4a).</sentence> <sentence>A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.</sentence> <sentence>Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s across the connection.</sentence> <sentence>Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and forwards a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> across the connection only when that <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is destined for a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> on the <concept>OTHER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, two <concept>MACHINE</concept>s residing on the same side of a bridge can exchange <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s without interfering with communication taking place on the <concept>OTHER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A bridge produces a more <concept>EFFICIENT SYSTEM</concept> than that produced by a repeater.</sentence> <sentence>A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, a switch produces a <concept>NETWORK</concept> consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.4b).</sentence> <sentence>As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s and forwards only those <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s destined for other spokes.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.</sentence> <sentence>It is important to note that when <concept>NETWORK</concept>s are connected via repeaters, bridges, and switches, the result is a single large <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The entire system operates in the same manner (using the same protocols) as each of the original smaller <concept>NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Sometimes, however, the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to be connected have incompatible characteristics.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, the characteristics of a <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept> are not readily compatible with an <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In these cases the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s must be connected in a manner that builds a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, known as an <concept>INTERNET</concept>, in which the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s maintain their individuality and continue to function as autonomous <concept>NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>(note that the generic term <concept>INTERNET</concept> is distinct from the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>INTERNET</concept>, written with an uppercase i, refers to a particular, <concept>WORLDWIDE INTERNET</concept> that we will study in later sections of this chapter.</sentence> <sentence>There are many other <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s of <concept>INTERNET</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION</concept> was handled by <concept>WORLDWIDE INTERNET</concept> systems well before the <concept>INTERNET</concept> was popularized.) the connection between <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form an <concept>INTERNET</concept> is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s used for forwarding <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between <concept>NETWORK</concept>s while allowing each <concept>NETWORK</concept> to maintain its unique internal characteristics.</sentence> <sentence>As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.5 depicts two wifi <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept>s and an ethernet <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> connected by routers.</sentence> <sentence>When a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in one of the <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s wants to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in the <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>, it first sends the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> in its <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>From there, the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> sends the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its associated router, and this router forwards the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the router at the ethernet.</sentence> <sentence>There the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is given to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> on the bus, and that <concept>MACHINE</concept> then forwards the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept> in the ethernet.</sentence> <sentence>The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s in their <concept>PROPER DIRECTION</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>This forwarding process is based on an <concept>INTERNET</concept>wide addressing system in which all the devices in an <concept>INTERNET</concept> (including the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.</sentence> <sentence>(thus, each <concept>MACHINE</concept> in one of the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s has two addresses: its original “local” address within its <concept>OWN NETWORK</concept> and its <concept>INTERNET</concept> address.) a <concept>MACHINE</concept> wanting to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in a distant <concept>NETWORK</concept> attaches the <concept>INTERNET</concept> address of the destination to the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and directs the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its local router.</sentence> <sentence>From there it is forwarded in the <concept>PROPER DIRECTION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> that contains the router’s knowledge about the direction in which <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s should be sent depending on their destination addresses.</sentence> <sentence>The “point” at which one <concept>NETWORK</concept> is linked to an <concept>INTERNET</concept> is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the <concept>NETWORK</concept> and the outside world.</sentence> <sentence>Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.</sentence> <sentence>In many cases a <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In other cases the <concept>TERM GATEWAY</concept> may be used to refer to more than just a router.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in most residential <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s that are connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, the <concept>TERM GATEWAY</concept> refers collectively to both the <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and the router connected to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Methods of process communication</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>The various activities (or processes) executing on the different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s within a <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or even executing on the <concept>SAME MACHINE</concept> via time-sharing/multitasking) must often communicate with each other to coordinate their actions and to perform their designated tasks.</sentence> <sentence><concept>SUCH COMMUNICATION</concept> between processes is called <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A popular convention used for <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept> is the client/ <concept>SERVER</concept> model.</sentence> <sentence>This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a <concept>SERVER</concept>, which satisfies the requests made by clients.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>EARLY APPLICATION</concept> of the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> appeared in <concept>NETWORK</concept>s connecting all the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a cluster of offices.</sentence> <sentence>In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the <concept>NETWORK</concept> where it was available to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this case the printer played the role of a <concept>SERVER</concept> (often called a <concept>PRINT SERVER</concept>), and the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the <concept>PRINT SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Another <concept>EARLY APPLICATION</concept> of the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> was used to reduce the cost of <concept>MAGNETIC DISK</concept> storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.</sentence> <sentence>Here one <concept>MACHINE</concept> in a <concept>NETWORK</concept> was equipped with a high-capacity <concept>MASS STORAGE</concept> system (usually a <concept>MAGNETIC DISK</concept>) that contained all of an organization’s records.</sentence> <sentence>Other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> then requested access to the records as they needed them.</sentence> <sentence>Thus the <concept>MACHINE</concept> that actually contained the records played the role of a <concept>SERVER</concept> (called a <concept>FILE SERVER</concept>), and the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the <concept>FILE SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Today the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> is used extensively in <concept>NETWORK</concept> applications, as we will see later in this chapter.</sentence> <sentence>However, the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> is not the only means of <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated p2p) model.</sentence> <sentence>Whereas the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> involves one process (the <concept>SERVER</concept>) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.6).</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, whereas a <concept>SERVER</concept> must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, applications of the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> include <concept>INSTANT MESSAGING</concept> in which people carry on a written conversation over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this case, one peer may receive a file from another and then provide that file to other peers.</sentence> <sentence>The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.</sentence> <sentence>The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> by establishing a central distribution center (the <concept>SERVER</concept>) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).</sentence> <sentence>One reason that the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is replacing the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This lack of a centralized base of operation leads to a more <concept>EFFICIENT SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Unfortunately, another reason for the popularity of file distribution systems based on the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is that, in cases of questionable legality, the lack of a <concept>CENTRAL SERVER</concept> makes legal efforts to enforce copyright laws more difficult.</sentence> <sentence>There are numerous cases, however, in which individuals have discovered that “difficult” does not mean “impossible” and have found themselves faced with significant liabilities due to copyright infringement violations.</sentence> <sentence>You might often read or hear the <concept>TERM PEER-TO-PEER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>, which is an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of how misuse of terminology can evolve when technical terms are adopted by the nontechnical community.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>TERM PEER-TO-PEER</concept> refers to a system by which two processes communicate over a <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or <concept>INTERNET</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>It is not a property of the <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or <concept>INTERNET</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>A process might use the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> to communicate with another process and later use the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> to communicate with another process over the same <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, it would be more accurate to speak of communicating by means of the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> rather than communicating over a peer-to-peer <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Distributed systems</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>With the success of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing technology, interaction between <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s via <concept>NETWORK</concept>s has become common and multifaceted.</sentence> <sentence>Many modern <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, <concept>COMPUTER</concept> games, and even the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that controls a <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> units that execute as processes on different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.</sentence> <sentence>But today, research is revealing a common infrastructure running throughout these systems, including such things as communication and security systems.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, efforts have been made to produce prefabricated systems that provide this basic infrastructure and therefore allow distributed applications to be constructed by merely developing the part of the system that is unique to the application.</sentence> <sentence>Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.</sentence> <sentence>Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The cost of these individual <concept>MACHINE</concept>s, plus the high-speed <concept>NETWORK</concept> to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced super<concept>COMPUTER</concept>, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.</sentence> <sentence>Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability—because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable—and load-balancing—because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.</sentence> <sentence>Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.</sentence> <sentence>Grid computing can involve specialized <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s participating in a grid.</sentence> <sentence><concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s include university of wisconsin’s condor system, or berkeley’s open infrastructure for <concept>NETWORK</concept> computing (boinc).</sentence> <sentence>Both of these systems are often installed on <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that are used for other purposes, such as pcs at work or at home, that can then volunteer computing power to the grid when the <concept>MACHINE</concept> is not otherwise being used.</sentence> <sentence>Enabled by the growing connectivity of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home pcs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.</sentence> <sentence>Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.</sentence> <sentence>Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to “the cloud,” which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Services such as amazon’s elastic compute cloud allow clients to rent virtual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s by the hour, without concern for where the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> hardware is actually located.</sentence> <sentence>Google drive and google apps allow users to collaborate on information or build web services without needing to know how many <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are working on the problem or where the relevant data are stored.</sentence> <sentence>Cloud computing services provide reasonable guarantees of reliability and scalability, but also raise concerns about privacy and security in a world where we may no longer know who owns and operates the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that we use.</sentence></section></br></br><section><sectionTitle><strong>4.2 The <concept>INTERNET</concept></strong></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence>The most notable <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of an <concept>INTERNET</concept> is the <concept>INTERNET</concept> (note the uppercase i), which originated from research projects going back to the early 1960s.</sentence> <sentence>The goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of <concept>COMPUTER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>s so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local disasters.</sentence> <sentence>Much of this work was sponsored by the <concept>US GOVERNMENT</concept> through the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa—pronounced <concept>"DAR-PA"</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>Over the years, the development of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> shifted from a governmentsponsored project to an academic research project, and today it is largely a commercial undertaking that links a worldwide combination of <concept>PERSONAL AREA NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept>s, and <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s involving millions of <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>INTERNET</concept> architecture</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>As we have already mentioned, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is a collection of connected <concept>NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>In general, these <concept>NETWORK</concept>s are constructed and maintained by organizations called <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> (isps).</sentence> <sentence>It is also customary to use the term <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> in reference to the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s themselves.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, we will speak of connecting to an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>, when what we really mean is connecting to the <concept>NETWORK</concept> provided by an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The system of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s operated by the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> can be classified in a hierarchy according to the role they play in the overall <concept>INTERNET</concept> structure (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.7).</sentence> <sentence>At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> that consist of very highspeed, high-capacity, international <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>These <concept>NETWORK</concept>s are thought of as the backbone of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>They are typically operated by large companies that are in the communications business.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> would be a company that originated as a <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> company and has expanded its scope into providing other communication services.</sentence> <sentence>Connecting to the tier-1 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> are the <concept>TIER-2 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept></concept> that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.</sentence> <sentence>(the distinction between the tier-1 and <concept>TIER-2 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept></concept> is often a matter of opinion.) again, these <concept>NETWORK</concept>s tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.</sentence> <sentence>Tier-1 and <concept>TIER-2 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept></concept> are essentially <concept>NETWORK</concept>s of routers that collectively provide the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s communication infrastructure.</sentence> <sentence>As such, they can be thought of as the core of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> is essentially an independent <concept>INTERNET</concept>, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a <concept>SINGLE AUTHORITY</concept> that is in the business of supplying <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to individual homes and businesses.</sentence> <sentence><concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to individuals within their organizations.</sentence> <sentence>The devices that individual users connect to the <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>s are known as <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s or hosts.</sentence> <sentence>These <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s may be laptops or pcs, but increasingly range over a multitude of other devices including telephones, video cameras, automobiles, and home appliances.</sentence> <sentence>After all, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is essentially a communications system, and thus any device that would benefit from communicating with other devices is a potential <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The technology by which <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s connect to larger <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is also varied.</sentence> <sentence>Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.</sentence> <sentence>The strategy is to connect the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> to an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> and thus provide <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> through that <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s within the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept>’s broadcast range.</sentence> <sentence>The area within the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> or group of <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept>s’ range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the <concept>NETWORK</concept> access is publicly available or free.</sentence> <sentence>Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.</sentence> <sentence>A similar technology is used by the cellular telephone industry where hot spots are known as cells and the “routers” generating the cells are coordinated to provide continuous service as an <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> moves from one cell to another.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>INTERNET</concept>2</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>Now that the <concept>INTERNET</concept> has shifted from a research project to a household commodity, the research community has moved on to a project called <concept>INTERNET</concept>2.</sentence> <sentence><concept>INTERNET</concept>2 is intended as an academic-only system and involves numerous universities working in partnership with industry and government.</sentence> <sentence>The goal is to conduct research in <concept>INTERNET</concept> applications requiring high bandwidth communication, such as remote access and control of costly state-of-the-art equipment such as telescopes and medical diagnostic devices.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of current research involves remote surgery performed by robot hands that mimic the hands of a distant surgeon who views the patient by video.</sentence> <sentence>You can learn more about <concept>INTERNET</concept>2 at http://www.<concept>INTERNET</concept>2.org..</sentence> <sentence>Other popular techniques for connecting to <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s use telephone lines or cable/satellite systems.</sentence> <sentence>These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> or to a customer’s router to which multiple <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s are connected.</sentence> <sentence>This latter tactic is popular for individual residences where a local hot spot is created by a router/<concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> connected to an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> by means of existing cable or telephone lines.</sentence> <sentence>Telephone, cable television, and satellite <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.</sentence> <sentence>Modern <concept>NETWORK</concept>s can be designed to carry digital data directly between <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s, but older, analog <concept>NETWORK</concept> infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Issues arising from these <concept>LEGACY ANALOG</concept> linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.</sentence> <sentence>The main arteries of <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept>s, and many <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept>s are relatively easy to modernize with high-speed digital technology such as fiber optics, but it can be far costlier to replace the existing copper telephone lines and coaxial cables that connect these arteries to each individual home or office.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, information that originated on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> continents away from an <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> may spend almost its entire trip on high-speed digital connections, only to traverse the “last mile” to the <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> over a slow, century-old analog phone line.</sentence> <sentence>As alluded to in chapter 2, several clever schemes have been developed to extend these <concept>LEGACY ANALOG</concept> links to accommodate transmission of digital data.</sentence> <sentence>Dsl modems, cable modems, satellite uplinks, and even direct fiber-optic connections to the home are used to bring broadband <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to <concept>END USER</concept>s.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>INTERNET</concept> addressing</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>As we learned in section 4.1, an <concept>INTERNET</concept> needs an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each <concept>COMPUTER</concept> in the system.</sentence> <sentence>In the <concept>INTERNET</concept> these addresses are known as <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence>(the term <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> refers to “<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>,” which is a term we will learn more about in section 4.4.) originally, each <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>v6 in section 4.4).</sentence> <sentence>Blocks of consecutively numbered <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es are awarded to <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> by the €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers (icann), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s operation.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to <concept>MACHINE</concept>s within their region of authority.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, <concept>MACHINE</concept>s throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept> are assigned unique <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence><concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).</sentence> <sentence>In summary, a 32-bit <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.</sentence> <sentence>Addresses in bit-pattern form (even when compressed using dotted decimal notation) are rarely conducive to human consumption.</sentence> <sentence>For this reason the <concept>INTERNET</concept> has an alternative addressing system in which <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are identified by mnemonic names.</sentence> <sentence>This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a “region” of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> operated by a <concept>SINGLE AUTHORITY</concept> such as a university, club, company, or <concept>GOVERNMENT AGENCY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>(the word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.) each domain must be registered with €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers—a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers.</sentence> <sentence>As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a <concept>MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME</concept>, which is unique among all the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence><concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.</sentence> <sentence>As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> of <concept>MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY</concept> is mu.edu.</sentence> <sentence>Note the suffix following the period.</sentence> <sentence>It is used to reflect the domain’s classification, which in this case is “educational” as indicated by the edu suffix.</sentence> <sentence>These suffixes are called top-level domains (tlds).</sentence> <sentence>Other top-level domains include com for commercial institutions, gov for <concept>US GOVERNMENT</concept> institutions, org for nonprofit organizations, museum for museums, info for unrestricted use, and net, which was originally intended for <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> but is now used on a much broader scale.</sentence> <sentence>In addition to these general top-level domains, there are also two-letter top-level domains for specific countries (called country-code top-level domains) such as au for australia and ca for canada.</sentence> <sentence>Once a domain’s mnemonic name is registered, the organization that registered the name is free to extend the name to obtain mnemonic identifiers for individual items within the domain.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, an individual host within <concept>MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY</concept> may be identified as eagle.mu.edu.</sentence> <sentence>Note that <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s are extended to the left and separated by a period.</sentence> <sentence>In some cases multiple extensions, called subdomains, are used as a means of organizing the names within a domain.</sentence> <sentence>These subdomains often represent different <concept>NETWORK</concept>s within the domain’s jurisdiction.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if yoyodyne corporation was assigned the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> yoyodyne.com, then an individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept> at yoyodyne might have a name such as overthruster.propulsion.yoyodyne.com, meaning that the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> overthruster is in the subdomain propulsion within the domain yoyodyne within the top-level domain com.</sentence> <sentence>(we should emphasize that the dotted notation used in <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>es is not related to the dotted decimal notation used to represent addresses in <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> form.) although <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>es are convenient for humans, <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are always transferred over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> by means of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, if a human wants to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a distant <concept>MACHINE</concept> and identifies the destination by means of a <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>, the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> being used must be able to convert that address into an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> before transmitting the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous <concept>SERVER</concept>s, called <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>s, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.</sentence> <sentence>Collectively, these <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>s are used as an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide directory system known as the <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> (dns).</sentence> <sentence>The process of using <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> to perform a translation is called a <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookup.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, for a <concept>MACHINE</concept> to be accessible by means of a <concept>MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME</concept>, that name must be represented in a <concept>NAME SERVER</concept> within the <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In those cases in which the entity establishing the domain has the resources, it can establish and maintain its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept> containing all the names within that domain.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, this is the model on which the domain system was originally based.</sentence> <sentence>Each registered domain represented a physical region of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> that was operated by a local authority such as a company, university, or <concept>GOVERNMENT AGENCY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This authority was essentially an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> that provided <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to its members by means of its own intranet that was linked to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>As part of this system, the organization maintained its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept> that provided translation services for all the names used within its domain.</sentence> <sentence>This model is still common today.</sentence> <sentence>However, many individuals or small organizations want to establish a domain presence on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> without committing the resources necessary to support it.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as kingsandqueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its <concept>OWN NETWORK</concept>, maintain a link from this <concept>NETWORK</concept> to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, and implement its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this case, the club can contract with an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to have that name included in the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This means that all <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookups regarding the new <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> will be directed to the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>, from which the proper translation will be obtained.</sentence> <sentence>In this way, many registered domains can reside within a single <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>, each often occupying only a small portion of a single <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>INTERNET</concept> applications</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>In the earlier days of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a <concept>NETWORK PROTOCOL</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A newsreader application contacted <concept>SERVER</concept>s using the <concept>NETWORK</concept> news transfer protocol (nntp), an application for listing and copying files across the <concept>NETWORK</concept> implemented the <concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> (ftp), or an application for accessing another <concept>COMPUTER</concept> from a great distance used the telnet protocol, or later the <concept>SECURE SHELL</concept> (ssh) protocol.</sentence> <sentence>As web<concept>SERVER</concept>s and <concept>BROWSER</concept>s have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional <concept>NETWORK</concept> applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful hyper text transfer protocol (http).</sentence> <sentence>Nevertheless, when examining a <concept>NETWORK PROTOCOL</concept> for an <concept>INTERNET</concept> application for the first time, it behooves us to begin with a few simpler <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s before moving on to <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> in the next section.</sentence> <sentence>Electronic mail a wide variety of systems now exist for exchanging <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s between <concept>END USER</concept>s over the <concept>NETWORK</concept>; <concept>INSTANT MESSAGING</concept> (im), <concept>BROWSER</concept>-based online chatting, twitter-based “tweets”, and the facebook “wall” are but a few. one of the oldest and most enduring uses of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is the electronic mail system, or email for short. while many users now rely on their <concept>BROWSER</concept> or a sophisticated application like microsoft’s outlook, apple’s mail, or mozilla’s thunderbird to read and compose their email, the <concept>ACTUAL TRANSMISSION</concept> of <concept>EMAIL MESSAGE</concept>s from one <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to another on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> remains the domain of basic <concept>NETWORK PROTOCOL</concept>s like <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>.</sentence> <sentence><concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> (smtp) defines a way that two <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> may interact when transmitting an <concept>EMAIL MESSAGE</concept> from one host to the other.</sentence> <sentence>consider the <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> case of a <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> mail.skaro.gov sending an email from <concept>END USER</concept> “dalek” to <concept>END USER</concept> “doctor” in the domain tardis.edu.</sentence> <sentence>First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the <concept>MAIL <concept>SERVER</concept> PROCESS</concept> on mail.tardis.edu.</sentence> <sentence>To accomplish this, it uses <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept>, another <concept>NETWORK PROTOCOL</concept>, to map the human-readable destination <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> to the proper <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> name, and then to its <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This is not unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing.</sentence> <sentence>Similarly, when the <concept>SERVER PROCESS</concept> at the <concept>OTHER END</concept> answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller.</sentence> <sentence>The transcript of their <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> exchange might look something like this: in line 1, the remote <concept>MAIL <concept>SERVER</concept> PROCESS</concept> answers the caller by announcing its name, the protocol it speaks, and other optional information, such as the version of protocol, and the date and time.</sentence> <sentence>In line 2, the sending <concept>MAIL <concept>SERVER</concept> PROCESS</concept> introduces itself. in line 3, the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept> acknowledges the name of the sending <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Most <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>s are not necessarily transmitted in ascii characters so easily interpreted by a human.</sentence> <sentence>To be sure, the quaint politeness of “pleased to meet you” in line 3 is neither appreciated by the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> on either end of this connection, nor essential to <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>’s proper function.</sentence> <sentence>However, this is actual behavior built into one popular <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>, held over from the early days of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> when human operators frequently needed to review <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> transcripts to debug incompatibilities between <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Untold millions of these exchanges occur on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> each day, known only to the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> agents that transport email across the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In the simplest case, the <concept>REMOTE MAIL SERVER</concept> will take mail.skaro.gov at its word in line 2, accepting that the sending <concept>SERVER</concept> is the <concept>MACHINE</concept> named mail from the domain skaro.gov.</sentence> <sentence><concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> is an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of a protocol originally built on trust that has subsequently been abused by spammers and other <concept>INTERNET</concept> miscreants.</sentence> <sentence>Modern <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>s must use extended versions of <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> or their equivalent to help ensure that email is transmitted securely.</sentence> <sentence>We discuss concerns about <concept>NETWORK SECURITY</concept> in greater detail in the final segment of this chapter.</sentence> <sentence>Returning to the transcript, in line 4 the sending <concept>SERVER</concept> announces that it has a mail <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to deliver, and identifies the sending user.</sentence> <sentence>In line 5, the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept> acknowledges that it will receive mail from this user at this domain.</sentence> <sentence>In line 6, the sending <concept>SERVER</concept> announces the recipient on the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In line 7, the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept> acknowledges that it will receive email destined for that user.</sentence> <sentence>In line 8, the sending <concept>SERVER</concept> dispenses with the introductions, and announces that it is ready to send the data, the actual body of the e-mail <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In line 8, the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept> acknowledges (with code 354, in accordance with the <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> protocol) that it is ready to receive the body of the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and includes a helpful human-readable instruction on how to conclude the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> transfer.</sentence> <sentence>In lines 10 through 14, the sending <concept>SERVER</concept> conveys the text of the <concept>EMAIL MESSAGE</concept> to be delivered.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept> acknowledges acceptance in line 15, and in line 17 acknowledges the sending <concept>SERVER</concept>’s quit announcement from line 16.</sentence> <sentence>The technical documents describing <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> define each of the allowed steps in a conversation such as the transcript above. the keywords helo, mail, rcpt, data, and quit are each precisely defined in terms of how they will be sent, what options can accompany them, and how they should be interpreted.</sentence> <sentence>Similarly, the <concept>REMOTE SERVER</concept>’s numeric response codes for acknowledgment are enumerated and defined.</sentence> <sentence><concept>SOFTWARE</concept> designers use a protocol description to develop algorithms that will correctly implement sending and receiving email over the <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Other protocols come into play for other aspects of transporting email.</sentence> <sentence>Because <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> was initially designed for transferring text <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s encoded with ascii, additional protocols such as multipurpose <concept>INTERNET</concept> mail extensions (mime) have been developed to convert non-ascii data to <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> compatible form.</sentence> <sentence>There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user’s <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>These are pop3 (post <concept>OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> 3) and <concept>INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL</concept> (imap).</sentence> <sentence>Post <concept>OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> 3 (pronounced “pop-three”) is the simpler of the two.</sentence> <sentence>Using post <concept>OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> 3, a user transfers (downloads) <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to his or her local <concept>COMPUTER</concept> where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.</sentence> <sentence>This is done on the user’s <concept>LOCAL MACHINE</concept> using the <concept>LOCAL MACHINE</concept>’s <concept>MASS STORAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence><concept>INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL</concept> (pronounced “eye-map”) allows a user to store and manipulate <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s and related materials on the <concept>SAME MACHINE</concept> as the <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s can maintain records at the <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> that are then accessible from any remote <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to which the user may have access.</sentence> </br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Voip</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of a more recent <concept>INTERNET</concept> application, consider <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> (voip) in which the <concept>INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE</concept> is used to provide voice communication similar to that of <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> systems.</sentence> <sentence>In its simplest form, <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> consists of two processes on different <concept>MACHINE</concept>s transferring audio data via the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept>—a process that in itself presents no significant problems.</sentence> <sentence>However, tasks such as initiating and receiving calls, linking <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> with <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> systems, and providing services such as emergency 911 communication are issues that extend beyond <concept>TRADITIONAL INTERNET</concept> applications.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, governments that own their country’s <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> companies view <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> as a threat and have either taxed it heavily or outlawed it completely.</sentence> <sentence>Existing <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> systems come in four different forms that are competing for popularity.</sentence> <sentence><concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> soft phones consist of peer-to-peer <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that allows two or more pcs to share a call with no more special hardware than a speaker and a microphone.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of a <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> soft phone system is skype, which also provides its clients with links to the <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION</concept> system.</sentence> <sentence>One drawback to skype is that it is a proprietary system, and thus much of its operational structure is not publicly known.</sentence> <sentence>This means that skype users must trust the integrity of the skype <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> without third-party verification.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, to receive calls, a skype user must leave his or her pc connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept> and available to the skype system, which means that some of the pc’s resources may be used to support other skype communications without the pc owner’s awareness—a feature that has generated some resistance.</sentence> <sentence>A second form of <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> consists of analog telephone adapters, which are devices that allow a user to connect his or her <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> to phone service provided by an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This choice is frequently bundled with <concept>TRADITIONAL INTERNET</concept> service and/or digital television service.</sentence> <sentence>The third type of <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> comes in the form of embedded <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> phones, which are devices that replace a <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE</concept> with an equivalent handset connected directly to a <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Embedded <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> phones are becoming increasingly common for large organizations, many of whom are replacing their traditional internal copper wire telephone systems with <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> over ethernet to reduce costs and enhance features.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, the current generation of smartphones use wireless <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> technology.</sentence> <sentence>That is, earlier generations of wireless phones only communicated with the telephone company’s <concept>NETWORK</concept> using that company’s protocols.</sentence> <sentence>Access to the <concept>INTERNET</concept> was obtained by gateways between the company’s <concept>NETWORK</concept> and the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, at which point signals were converted to the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> system.</sentence> <sentence>However, the 4g phone <concept>NETWORK</concept> is an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>-based <concept>NETWORK</concept> throughout, which means a 4g telephone is

WEB</concept></strong></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence>The <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB</concept> had its origins in the work of tim berners-lee who realized the potential of combining <concept>INTERNET</concept> technology with the concept of linkeddocuments, called hypertext.</sentence> <sentence>His first <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> for implementing the web was released in december, 1990.</sentence> <sentence>While this early prototype did not yet support multimedia data, it included the key components of what we now recognize as the <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB</concept>: a <concept>HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT</concept> format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents; a protocol for transferring hypertext across the <concept>NETWORK</concept>, and a <concept>SERVER PROCESS</concept> that supplied hypertext pages upon request.</sentence> <sentence>From this humble beginning, the web quickly grew to support images, audio and video, and by the mid-1990s had become the dominant application powering the growth of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Web implementation</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence><concept>SOFTWARE</concept> packages that allow users to access hypertext on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> fall into one of two categories: <concept>BROWSER</concept>s and web<concept>SERVER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>BROWSER</concept> resides on the user’s <concept>COMPUTER</concept> and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.</sentence> <sentence>Common <concept>INTERNET</concept> <concept>BROWSER</concept>s include firefox, safari, and <concept>INTERNET</concept> explorer.</sentence> <sentence>The web<concept>SERVER</concept> resides on a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> containing <concept>HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT</concept>s to be accessed.</sentence> <sentence>Its task is to provide access to the documents under its control as requested by clients (<concept>BROWSER</concept>s).</sentence> <sentence><concept>HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT</concept>s are normally transferred between <concept>BROWSER</concept>s and web<concept>SERVER</concept>s using a protocol known as the <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> (http).</sentence> <sentence>In order to locate and retrieve documents on the web, each document is given a unique address called a <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> (url).</sentence> <sentence>Each <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> contains the information needed by a <concept>BROWSER</concept> to contact the proper <concept>SERVER</concept> and request the <concept>DESIRED DOCUMENT</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her <concept>BROWSER</concept> with the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> of the <concept>DESIRED DOCUMENT</concept> and then instructs the <concept>BROWSER</concept> to retrieve and display the document.</sentence> <sentence>A typical <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> is presented in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.8.</sentence> <sentence>It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the <concept>SERVER</concept> controlling access to the document, the <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept> of the <concept>MACHINE</concept> containing the <concept>SERVER</concept>, the <concept>DIRECTORY PATH</concept> needed for the <concept>SERVER</concept> to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.</sentence> <sentence>In short, the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.8 tells a <concept>BROWSER</concept> to contact the web<concept>SERVER</concept> on the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> known as eagle.mu.edu using the protocol <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> and to retrieve the document named julius_caesar.html found within the subdirectory shakespeare within the directory called authors.</sentence> <sentence>Sometimes a <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> might not explicitly contain all the segments shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.8.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if the <concept>SERVER</concept> does not need to follow a <concept>DIRECTORY PATH</concept> to reach the document, no <concept>DIRECTORY PATH</concept> will appear in the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, sometimes a <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> will consist of only a protocol and the <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept> of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In these cases, the web<concept>SERVER</concept> at that <concept>COMPUTER</concept> will return a predetermined document, typically called a <concept>HOME PAGE</concept>, that usually describes the information available at that website.</sentence> <sentence>Such shortened <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept>s provide a simple means of contacting organizations.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> http://www.google.com will lead to the <concept>HOME PAGE</concept> of google, which contains hyperlinks to the services, products, and documents relating to the company.</sentence> <sentence>To further simplify locating websites, many <concept>BROWSER</concept>s assume that the <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL PROTOCOL</concept> should be used if no protocol is identified.</sentence> <sentence>These <concept>BROWSER</concept>s correctly retrieve the google <concept>HOME PAGE</concept> when given the “<concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept>” consisting merely of www .google.com.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept></strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>A traditional <concept>HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT</concept> is similar to a text file because its text is encoded character by character using a system such as ascii or unicode.</sentence> <sentence>The distinction is that a <concept>HYPERTEXT DOCUMENT</concept> also contains special symbols, called tags, that describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (such as images) should accompany the document, and which items within the document are linked to other documents.</sentence> <sentence>This system of tags is known as <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> (html).</sentence> <sentence>Thus, it is in terms of <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> that an author of a webpage describes the information that a <concept>BROWSER</concept> needs in order to present the page on the user’s screen and to find any related documents referenced by the current page.</sentence> <sentence>The process is analogous to adding typesetting directions to a plain typed text (perhaps using a red pen) so that a typesetter will know how the material should appear in its final form.</sentence> <sentence>In the case of hypertext, the red markings are replaced by <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> tags, and a <concept>BROWSER</concept> ultimately plays the role of the typesetter, reading the <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> tags to learn how the text is to be presented on the <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept>-encoded version (called the <concept>SOURCE VERSION</concept>) of an extremely <concept>SIMPLE WEBPAGE</concept> is shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9a.</sentence> <sentence>Note that the tags are delineated by the symbols < and >.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT</concept> consists of two sections—a head (surrounded by the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags) and a body (surrounded by the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags).</sentence> <sentence>The distinction between the head and body of a webpage is similar to that of the head and body of an interoffice memo.</sentence> <sentence>In both cases, the head contains preliminary information about the document (date, subject, etc.</sentence> <sentence>In the case of a memo).</sentence> <sentence>The body contains the meat of the document, which in the case of a webpage is the material to be presented on the <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept> when the page is displayed.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> the <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> (w3c) was formed in 1994 to promote the <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB</concept> by developing protocol standards (known as <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> standards).</sentence> <sentence><concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> is headquartered at cern, the high-energy particle physics laboratory in geneva, switzerland.</sentence> <sentence>Cern is where the original <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> markup language was developed as well as the <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL PROTOCOL</concept> for transferring <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> documents over the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Today <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> is the source of many standards (including standards for <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> and numerous multimedia applications) that lead to compatibility over a wide range of <concept>INTERNET</concept> products.</sentence> <sentence>You can learn more about <concept>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</concept> via its website at http://www.w3c.org.</sentence> <sentence>The head of the webpage displayed in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9a contains only the title of the document (surrounded by “title” tags).</sentence> <sentence>This title is only for documentation purposes; it is not part of the page that is to be displayed on the <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The material that is displayed on the screen is contained in the body of the document.</sentence> <sentence>The first entry in the body of the document in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9a is a <concept>LEVEL-ONE HEADING</concept> (surrounded by the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; tags) containing the text “my web page.” being a <concept>LEVEL-ONE HEADING</concept> means that the <concept>BROWSER</concept> should display this text prominently on the screen.</sentence> <sentence>The next entry in the body is a paragraph of text (surrounded by the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags) containing the text “click here for another page.” <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9b shows the page as it would be presented on a <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept> by a <concept>BROWSER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In its present form, the page in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9 is not fully functional in the sense that nothing will happen when the viewer clicks on the word here, even though the page implies that doing so will cause the <concept>BROWSER</concept> to display another page.</sentence> <sentence>To cause the appropriate action, we must link the word here to another document.</sentence> <sentence>Let us suppose that, when the word here is clicked, we want the <concept>BROWSER</concept> to retrieve and display the page at the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> http://crafty.com/demo.html.</sentence> <sentence>To do so, we must first surround the word here in the <concept>SOURCE VERSION</concept> of the page with the tags &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt;, which are called anchor tags.</sentence> <sentence>Inside the opening anchor tag we insert the parameter href = http://crafty.com/demo.html (as shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.10a) indicating that the hypertext reference (href) associated with the tag is the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> following the <concept>EQUAL SIGN</concept> (http://crafty.com/demo.html).</sentence> <sentence>Having added the anchor tags, the webpage will now appear on a <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept> as shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.10b.</sentence> <sentence>Note that this is identical to <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.9b except that the word here is highlighted by color indicating that it is a link to another webpage.</sentence> <sentence>Clicking on such highlighted terms will cause the <concept>BROWSER</concept> to retrieve and display the associated webpage.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, it is by means of anchor tags that webpages are linked to each other.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, we should indicate how an image could be included in our <concept>SIMPLE WEBPAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For this purpose, let us suppose that a jpeg encoding of the image we want to include is stored as the file named ourpic.jpg in the directory images at images.com and is available via the web<concept>SERVER</concept> at that location.</sentence> <sentence>Under these conditions, we can tell a <concept>BROWSER</concept> to display the image at the top of the webpage by inserting the <concept>IMAGE TAG</concept> &lt;img src = "http://images.com/images/ourpic.jpg"> immediately after the &lt;body&gt; tag in the <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This tells the <concept>BROWSER</concept> that the image named ourpic.jpg should be displayed at the beginning of the document.</sentence> <sentence>(the term src is short for “source,” meaning that the information following the <concept>EQUAL SIGN</concept> indicates the source of the image to be displayed.) when the <concept>BROWSER</concept> finds this tag, it will send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER</concept> at images .com requesting the image called ourpic.jpg and then display the image appropriately.</sentence> <sentence>If we moved the <concept>IMAGE TAG</concept> to the end of the document just before the &lt;/body&gt; tag, then the <concept>BROWSER</concept> would display the image at the bottom of the webpage.</sentence> <sentence>There are, of course, more sophisticated techniques for positioning an image on a webpage, but these need not concern us now.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong><concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept></strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence><concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> is essentially a notational system by which a <concept>TEXT DOCUMENT</concept> along with the document’s appearance can be encoded as a simple text file.</sentence> <sentence>In a similar manner we can also encode nontextual material as text files—an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> being <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>At first glance the pattern of staffs, measure bars, and notes in which music is traditionally represented does not conform to the character-bycharacter format dictated by text files.</sentence> <sentence>However, we can overcome this problem by developing an alternative notation system.</sentence> <sentence>More precisely, we could agree to represent the start of a staff by <staff clef = "treble">, the end of the staff by &lt;/staff&gt;, a time signature with the form &lt;time&gt; 2/4 &lt;/time&gt;, the beginning and ending of a measure by <concept>&lt; MEASURE</concept>&gt; and &lt;/measure&gt;, respectively, a note such as an eighth note on c as <notes> egth c </notes>, and so on.</sentence> <sentence>Then the text could be used to encode the music shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.11.</sentence> <sentence>Using such notation, <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept> could be encoded, modified, stored, and transferred over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as text files.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> could be written to present the contents of such files in the form of traditional <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept> or even to play the music on a synthesizer.</sentence> <sentence>Note that our <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept> encoding system encompasses the <concept>SAME STYLE</concept> used by <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>We chose to delineate the tags that identify components by the symbols < and >.</sentence> <sentence>We chose to indicate the beginning and end of structures (such as a staff, string of notes, or measure) by tags of the same name—the ending tag being designated by a slash (a <concept>&lt; MEASURE</concept>&gt; was terminated with the tag &lt;/measure&gt;).</sentence> <sentence>And we chose to indicate special attributes within tags by expressions such as clef = "treble".</sentence> <sentence>This <concept>SAME STYLE</concept> could also be used to develop systems for representing other formats such as mathematical expressions and graphics.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> (xml) is a standardized style (similar to that of our music <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>) for designing notational systems for representing data as text files.</sentence> <sentence>(actually, <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> is a simplified derivative of an older set of standards called the standard generalized markup language, better known as sgml.) following the <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE STANDARD</concept>, notational systems called markup languages have been developed for representing mathematics, multimedia presentations, and music.</sentence> <sentence>In fact, <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> is the markup language based on the <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE STANDARD</concept> that was developed for representing webpages.</sentence> <sentence>(actually, the original version of <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> was developed before the <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE STANDARD</concept> was solidified, and therefore some features of <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> do not strictly conform to <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>That is why you might see references to xhtml, which is the version of <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> that rigorously adheres to <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept>.) <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> provides a good <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of how standards are designed to have wideranging applications.</sentence> <sentence>Rather than designing individual, unrelated markup languages for encoding various types of documents, the approach represented by <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> is to develop a standard for markup languages in general.</sentence> <sentence>With this standard, markup languages can be developed for various applications.</sentence> <sentence>Markup languages developed in this manner possess a uniformity that allows them to be combined to obtain markup languages for complex applications such as <concept>TEXT DOCUMENT</concept>s that contain segments of <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept> and mathematical expressions.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, we should note that <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> allows the development of new markup languages that differ from <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> in that they emphasize semantics rather than appearance.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, with <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> the ingredients in a recipe can be marked so that they appear as a list in which each ingredient is positioned on a separate line.</sentence> <sentence>But if we used semantic-oriented tags, ingredients in a recipe could be marked as ingredients (perhaps using the tags &lt;ingredient&gt; and </ ingredient>) rather than merely items in a list.</sentence> <sentence>The difference is subtle but important.</sentence> <sentence>The semantic approach would allow <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept>s (websites that assist users in locating web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.</sentence> <sentence>More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept> can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement “this lasagna does not contain spinach.” in turn, by using an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide standard for marking documents according to semantics rather than appearance, a world wide semantic web, rather than the world wide syntactic web we have today, would be created.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Client-side and <concept>SERVER</concept>-side activities</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>Consider now the steps that would be required for a <concept>BROWSER</concept> to retrieve the <concept>SIMPLE WEBPAGE</concept> shown in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.10 and display it on the <concept>BROWSER</concept>’s <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>First, playing the role of a client, the <concept>BROWSER</concept> would use the information in a <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> (perhaps obtained from the person using the <concept>BROWSER</concept>) to contact the web<concept>SERVER</concept> controlling access to the page and ask that a copy of the page be transferred to it.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>SERVER</concept> would respond by sending the <concept>TEXT DOCUMENT</concept> displayed in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.10a to the <concept>BROWSER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>BROWSER</concept> would then interpret the <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> tags in the document to determine how the page should be displayed and present the document on its <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept> accordingly.</sentence> <sentence>The user of the <concept>BROWSER</concept> would see an image like that depicted in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.10b.</sentence> <sentence>If the user then clicked the mouse over the word here, the <concept>BROWSER</concept> would use the <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> in the associated anchor tag to contact the appropriate <concept>SERVER</concept> to obtain and display another webpage.</sentence> <sentence>In summary, the process consists of the <concept>BROWSER</concept> merely fetching and displaying webpages as directed by the user.</sentence> <sentence>But what if we wanted a webpage involving animation or one that allows a customer to fill out an order form and submit the order? these needs would require additional activity by either the <concept>BROWSER</concept> or the web<concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a <concept>BROWSER</concept>) or <concept>SERVER</concept>-side activities if they are performed by a <concept>SERVER</concept> (such as a web<concept>SERVER</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, suppose a <concept>TRAVEL AGENT</concept> wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a <concept>CUSTOMIZED WEBPAGE</concept> containing only the information pertinent to that customer’s needs.</sentence> <sentence>In this case the <concept>TRAVEL AGENT</concept>’s website would first provide a webpage that presents a customer with the available destinations.</sentence> <sentence>On the basis of this information, the customer would specify the destinations of interest and desired dates of travel (a <concept>CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>This information would then be transferred back to the agent’s <concept>SERVER</concept> where it would be used to construct the appropriate <concept>CUSTOMIZED WEBPAGE</concept> (a <concept>SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>), which would then be sent to the customer’s <concept>BROWSER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Another <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> occurs when using the services of a <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this case a user at the client specifies a topic of interest (a <concept>CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>), which is then transferred to the <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept> where a <concept>CUSTOMIZED WEBPAGE</concept> identifying documents of possible interest is constructed (a <concept>SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>) and sent back to the client.</sentence> <sentence>Still another <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> occurs in the case of web mail—an increasingly popular means by which <concept>COMPUTER</concept> users are able to access their email by means of web <concept>BROWSER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>In this case, the web<concept>SERVER</concept> is an intermediary between the client and the client’s <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Essentially, the web<concept>SERVER</concept> builds webpages that contain information from the <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> (a <concept>SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>) and sends those pages to the client where the client’s <concept>BROWSER</concept> displays them (a <concept>CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>).</sentence> <sentence>Conversely, the <concept>BROWSER</concept> allows the user to create <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s (a <concept>CLIENT-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>) and sends that information to the web<concept>SERVER</concept>, which then forwards the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to the <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> (a <concept>SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept>) for mailing.</sentence> <sentence>There are numerous systems for performing client- and <concept>SERVER</concept>-side activities, each competing with the others for prominence.</sentence> <sentence>An early and still popular means of controlling client-side activities is to include programs written in the language javascript (developed by netscape communications, inc.) within the <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT</concept> for the webpage.</sentence> <sentence>From there a <concept>BROWSER</concept> can extract the programs and follow them as needed.</sentence> <sentence>Another approach (developed by <concept>SUN MICROSYSTEM</concept>s) is to first transfer a webpage to a <concept>BROWSER</concept> and then transfer additional program units called applets (written in the language java) to the <concept>BROWSER</concept> as requested within the <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE SOURCE DOCUMENT</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Still another approach is the system flash (developed by macromedia) by which extensive multimedia client-side presentations can be implemented.</sentence> <sentence>An early means of controlling <concept>SERVER</concept>-side activities was to use a set of standards called cgi (common gateway interface) by which clients could request the execution of programs stored at a <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A variation of this approach (developed by <concept>SUN MICROSYSTEM</concept>s) is to allow clients to cause program units called servlets to be executed at the <concept>SERVER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A simplified version of the servlet approach is applicable when the requested <concept>SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY</concept> is the construction of a <concept>CUSTOMIZED WEBPAGE</concept>, as in our <concept>TRAVEL AGENT</concept> <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this case webpage templates called java<concept>SERVER</concept> pages (jsp) are stored at the web<concept>SERVER</concept> and completed using information received from a client.</sentence> <sentence>A similar approach is used by microsoft, where the templates from which <concept>CUSTOMIZED WEBPAGE</concept>s are constructed are called active <concept>SERVER</concept> pages (asp).</sentence> <sentence>In contrast to these proprietary systems, php (originally standing for personal <concept>HOME PAGE</concept> but now considered to mean php hypertext preprocessor) is an open source system for implementing <concept>SERVER</concept>-side functionality.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the security and ethical problems that arise from allowing clients and <concept>SERVER</concept>s to execute programs on the other’s <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The fact that web<concept>SERVER</concept>s routinely transfer programs to clients where they are executed leads to ethical questions on the <concept>SERVER SIDE</concept> and security questions on the <concept>CLIENT SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>If the client blindly executes any program sent to it by a web<concept>SERVER</concept>, it opens itself to malicious activities by the <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Likewise, the fact that clients can cause programs to be executed at the <concept>SERVER</concept> leads to ethical questions on the <concept>CLIENT SIDE</concept> and security questions on the <concept>SERVER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>If the <concept>SERVER</concept> blindly executes any program sent to it by a client, security breaches and potential damage at the <concept>SERVER</concept> could result.</sentence></section></br></br><section><sectionTitle><strong>4.4 <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>s</strong></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence>In this section we investigate how

accomplished by means of a hierarchy of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> units, which perform tasks analogous to those that would be performed if you were to send a gift in a package from the west coast of the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s to a friend on the east coast (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.12).</sentence> <sentence>You would first wrap the gift as a package and write the appropriate address on the outside of the package.</sentence> <sentence>Then, you would take the package to a <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept> such as the u.s.</sentence> <sentence>Postal service.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept> might place the package along with others in a large container and deliver the container to an airline, whose services it has contracted.</sentence> <sentence>The airline would place the container in an aircraft and transfer it to the destination city, perhaps with intermediate stops along the way.</sentence> <sentence>At the <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept>, the airline would remove the container from the aircraft and give it to the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept>’s office at the destination.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept> would take your package out of the container and deliver it to the addressee.</sentence> <sentence>In short, the transportation of the gift would be carried out by a three-level hierarchy: (1) the user level (consisting of you and your friend), (2) the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept>, and (3) the airline.</sentence> <sentence>Each level uses the next lower level as an abstract tool.</sentence> <sentence>(you are not concerned with the details of the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept>, and the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept> is not concerned with the internal operations of the airline.) each level in the hierarchy has representatives at both the origin and the destination, with the representatives at the destination tending to do the reverse of their counterparts at the origin.</sentence> <sentence>Such is the case with <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> for controlling communication over the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, except that the <concept>INTERNET SOFTWARE</concept> has four layers rather than three, each consisting of a collection of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> routines rather than people and businesses.</sentence> <sentence>The four layers are known as the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>, the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept>, the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>, and the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.13).</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>MESSAGE</concept> typically originates in the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>From there it is passed down through the transport and <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>s as it is prepared for transmission, and finally it is transmitted by the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is received by the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> at the destination and passed back up the hierarchy until it is delivered to the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> at the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Let us investigate this process more thoroughly by tracing a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> as it finds its way through the system (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.14).</sentence> <sentence>We begin our journey with the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> consists of those <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> units such as clients and <concept>SERVER</concept>s that use <concept>INTERNET</concept> communication to carry out their tasks.</sentence> <sentence>Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> in the application classification presented in section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> for transferring files using <concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> or for providing remote login capabilities using <concept>SECURE SHELL</concept> have become so common that they are normally considered utility <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> uses the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> to send and receive <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> in much the same way that you would use a <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept> to send and receive packages.</sentence> <sentence>Just as it is your responsibility to provide an address compatible with the specifications of the <concept>SHIPPING COMPANY</concept>, it is the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>’s responsibility to provide an address that is compatible with the <concept>INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>To fulfill this need, the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> may use the services of the <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>s within the <concept>INTERNET</concept> to translate <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>es used by humans into <concept>INTERNET</concept>-compatible <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>IMPORTANT TASK</concept> of the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> is to accept <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> and to ensure that the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are properly formatted for transmission over the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Toward this latter goal, the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> divides long <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s into small segments, which are transmitted over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as individual units.</sentence> <sentence>This division is necessary because a single long <concept>MESSAGE</concept> can obstruct the flow of other <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s at the <concept>INTERNET</concept> routers where numerous <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s cross paths.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, small segments of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s can interweave at these points, whereas a long <concept>MESSAGE</concept> forces others to wait while it passes (much like cars waiting for a long train to pass at a railroad crossing).</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>From this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s until they reach the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> at their <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>It is quite possible for the packets related to a common <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to follow different paths through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>It is the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>’s job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet’s path through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In fact, the combination of the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> and the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> below it constitutes the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> residing on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> routers.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> is in charge of maintaining the router’s <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, when the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> at a packet’s origin receives the packet from the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept>, it uses its <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> to determine where the packet should be sent to get it started on its journey.</sentence> <sentence>Having determined the <concept>PROPER DIRECTION</concept>, the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> hands the packet to the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> for <concept>ACTUAL TRANSMISSION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> has the responsibility of transferring the packet.</sentence> <sentence>Thus the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> must deal with the communication details particular to the individual <concept>NETWORK</concept> in which the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> resides.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, if that <concept>NETWORK</concept> is an ethernet, the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> applies <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€.</sentence> <sentence>If the <concept>NETWORK</concept> is a <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>, the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> applies <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept></concept>#€.</sentence> <sentence>When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> at the <concept>OTHER END</concept> of the connection.</sentence> <sentence>There, the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> hands the packet up to its <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> where the packet’s <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept> is compared to the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>’s <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> to determine the direction of the packet’s next step.</sentence> <sentence>With this decision made, the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> returns the packet to the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> to be forwarded along its way.</sentence> <sentence>In this manner each packet hops from <concept>MACHINE</concept> to <concept>MACHINE</concept> on its way to its <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Note that only the link and <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>s are involved at the intermediate stops during this journey (see again <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.14), and thus these are the only layers present on routers, as previously noted.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, to minimize the delay at each of these intermediate “stops,” the forwarding role of the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> within a router is closely integrated with the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, the time required for a modern router to forward a packet is measured in millionths of a second.</sentence> <sentence>At a packet’s <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept>, it is the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> that recognizes that the packet’s journey is complete.</sentence> <sentence>In that case the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> hands the packet to its <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> rather than forwarding it.</sentence> <sentence>As the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> receives packets from the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>, it extracts the underlying <concept>MESSAGE</concept> segments and reconstructs the original <concept>MESSAGE</concept> according to the sequence numbers that were provided by the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> at the <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Once the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is assembled, the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> hands it to the appropriate unit within the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>—thus completing the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> transmission process.</sentence> <sentence>Determining which unit within the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> should receive an incoming <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is an <concept>IMPORTANT TASK</concept> of the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>This is handled by assigning unique <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept>s (not related to the i/o ports discussed in chapter 2) to the various units and requiring that the appropriate <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept> be appended to a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>’s address before starting the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> on its journey.</sentence> <sentence>Then, once the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is received by the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> at the destination, the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> merely hands the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> at the designated <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Users of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> rarely need to be concerned with <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept>s because the common applications have universally accepted <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if a web <concept>BROWSER</concept> is asked to retrieve the document whose <concept>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR</concept> is http://www .zoo.org/animals/frog.html, the <concept>BROWSER</concept> assumes that it should contact the <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SERVER</concept> at www.zoo.org via <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept> 80.</sentence> <sentence>Likewise, when sending email, an <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> client assumes that it should communicate with the <concept>SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept> through <concept>PORT NUMBER</concept> 25.</sentence> <sentence>In summary, communication over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> involves the interaction of four layers of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> deals with <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from the application’s point of view.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> converts these <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s into segments that are compatible with the <concept>INTERNET</concept> and reassembles <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s that are received before delivering them to the appropriate application.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> deals with directing the segments through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> handles the <concept>ACTUAL TRANSMISSION</concept> of segments from one <concept>MACHINE</concept> to another.</sentence> <sentence>With all this activity, it is somewhat amazing that the response time of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is measured in milliseconds, so that many transactions appear to take place instantaneously.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>The <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>The demand for <concept>OPEN NETWORK</concept>s has generated a need for published standards by which manufacturers can supply equipment and <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that function properly with products from other vendors.</sentence> <sentence>One standard that has resulted is the <concept>OPEN SYSTEM</concept> interconnection (osi) reference model, produced by the <concept>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION</concept> for standardization.</sentence> <sentence>This standard is based on a seven-level hierarchy as opposed to the <concept>FOUR-LEVEL HIERARCHY</concept> we have just described.</sentence> <sentence>It is an often-quoted model because it carries the authority of an <concept>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION</concept>, but it has been slow to replace the four-level point of view, mainly because it was established after the <concept>FOUR-LEVEL HIERARCHY</concept> had already become the de facto standard for the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the <concept>INTERNET</concept> to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.</sentence> <sentence>Actually, the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> (tcp) and the <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> (ip) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection—so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite is rather misleading.</sentence> <sentence>More precisely, <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> defines a version of the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>We say a version because the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite provides for more than one way of implementing the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept>; one of the other options is defined by the <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> (udp).</sentence> <sentence>This diversity is analogous to the fact that when shipping a package, you have a choice of different shipping companies, each of which offers the same basic service but with its own unique characteristics.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, depending on the particular quality of service required, a unit within the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept> might choose to send data via a <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> or <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> version of the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.15).</sentence> <sentence>There are several differences between <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> and <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>One is that before sending a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> as requested by the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>, a <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> based on <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> sends its own <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> at the destination telling it that a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is about to be sent.</sentence> <sentence>It then waits for this <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to be acknowledged before starting to send the <concept>APPLICATION LAYER</concept>’s <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In this manner, a €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€ is said to establish a connection before sending a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> based on <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> does not establish such a connection prior to sending a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>It merely sends the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the address it was given and forgets about it.</sentence> <sentence>For all it knows, the destination <concept>COMPUTER</concept> might not even be operational.</sentence> <sentence>For this reason, <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is called a connectionless protocol.</sentence> <sentence>Another difference between <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> and <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is that €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€s at the origin and destination work together by means of acknowledgments and packet retransmissions to assure that all segments of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> are successfully transferred to the destination.</sentence> <sentence>For this reason <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> is called a reliable protocol, whereas <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept>, which does not offer such retransmission services, is said to be an unreliable protocol.</sentence> <sentence>Still another distinction between <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> and <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is that <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> provides for both flow control, meaning that a €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€ at a <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept> can reduce the rate at which it transmits segments to keep from overwhelming its counterpart at the destination, as well as congestion control, meaning that a €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€ at a <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept> can adjust its transmission rate to alleviate congestion between it and the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>All this does not mean that <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is a poor choice.</sentence> <sentence>After all, a <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> based on <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is more streamlined than a layer based on <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept>, that option might be the better choice.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the efficiency of <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> makes it the protocol of choice for <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookups and <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>However, because email is less time sensitive, <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>s use <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> to transfer email.</sentence> <sentence><concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> is the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, and routing, which involves updating the layer’s <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> to reflect changing conditions.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, a router may malfunction, meaning that traffic should no longer be forwarded in its direction, or a section of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> may become congested, meaning that traffic should be routed around the blockage.</sentence> <sentence>Much of the <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>s as they interchange routing information.</sentence> <sentence>An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept></concept> at a <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept> prepares a packet, it appends a value called a <concept>HOP COUNT</concept>, or time to live, to that packet.</sentence> <sentence>This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Each time an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept></concept> forwards a packet, it decrements that packet’s <concept>HOP COUNT</concept> by one.</sentence> <sentence>With this information, the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> can protect the <concept>INTERNET</concept> from packets circling endlessly within the system.</sentence> <sentence>Although the <concept>INTERNET</concept> continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial <concept>HOP COUNT</concept> of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today’s <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For years a version of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> known as ipv4 (<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> four) has been used for implementing the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> within the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>However, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is rapidly outgrowing the 32-bit <concept>INTERNET</concept> addressing system dictated by <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> four.</sentence> <sentence>To solve this problem as well as to implement other improvements such as multicast, a new version of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> known as ipv6 (<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> six), which uses <concept>INTERNET</concept> addresses consisting of 128 bits, has been established.</sentence> <sentence>The process of converting from <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> four to <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION</concept> six is currently underway—this is the conversion that was alluded to in our introduction of <concept>INTERNET</concept> addresses in section 4.2—and it is expected that the use of 32-bit addresses within the <concept>INTERNET</concept> will be extinct by 2025.</sentence></section></br></br><section><sectionTitle><strong>4.5 Security</strong></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence>When a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> is connected to a <concept>NETWORK</concept>, it becomes subject to <concept>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS</concept> and vandalism.</sentence> <sentence>In this section we address topics associated with these problems.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Forms of attack</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>There are numerous ways that a <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept> and its contents can be attacked via <concept>NETWORK</concept> connections.</sentence> <sentence>Many of these incorporate the use of <concept>MALICIOUS SOFTWARE</concept> (collectively called malware).</sentence> <sentence>Such <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> might be transferred to, and executed on, the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> itself, or it might attack the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> from a distance.</sentence> <sentence><concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that is transferred to, and executed on, the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> under attack include viruses, worms, <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept>s, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM</concept> in november 1988 a worm released into the <concept>INTERNET</concept> caused significant disruption of service.</sentence> <sentence>Consequently, the u.s.</sentence> <sentence>Defense advanced research projects agency (darpa—pronounced <concept>"DAR-PA"</concept>) formed the <concept>COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM</concept> (cert—pronounced “sert”), located at the <concept>COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM</concept> coordination center at carnegie- mellon university.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM</concept> is the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s security “watchdog.” among its duties are the investigation of security problems, the issuance of security alerts, and the implementation of public awareness campaigns to improve <concept>INTERNET</concept> security.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM</concept> coordination center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.</sentence> <sentence>A virus is <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that infects a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Then, when the “host” program is executed, the virus is also executed.</sentence> <sentence>When executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the <concept>OPERATING SYSTEM</concept>, erasing large blocks of <concept>MASS STORAGE</concept>, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.</sentence> <sentence>A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a <concept>NETWORK</concept>, taking up residence in <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s and forwarding copies of itself to other <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism.</sentence> <sentence>A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm’s replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire <concept>NETWORK</concept> or <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept> is a program that enters a <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept> disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.</sentence> <sentence>Once in the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>, however, the <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept> performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.</sentence> <sentence>Sometimes these additional activities start immediately.</sentence> <sentence>In other instances, the <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept> might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected date.</sentence> <sentence><concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept>s often arrive in the form of attachments to enticing <concept>EMAIL MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>When the attachment is opened (that is, when the recipient asks to view the attachment), the misdeeds of the <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept> are activated.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.</sentence> <sentence>Another form of <concept>MALICIOUS SOFTWARE</concept> is spyware (sometimes called sniffing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>), which is <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that collects information about activities at the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.</sentence> <sentence>Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.</sentence> <sentence>In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>’s keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.</sentence> <sentence>As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.</sentence> <sentence>The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous “lines” in hopes that someone will “take the bait.” phishing is often carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more than an old telephone con.</sentence> <sentence>The perpetrator sends <concept>EMAIL MESSAGE</concept>s posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> agency.</sentence> <sentence>The email asks the potential victim for information that is supposedly needed for legitimate purposes.</sentence> <sentence>However, the information obtained is used by the perpetrator for hostile purposes.</sentence> <sentence>In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> in a <concept>NETWORK</concept> can also be attacked by <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> being executed on other <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in the system.</sentence> <sentence>An <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> is a <concept>DENIAL OF SERVICE</concept> (dos) attack, which is the process of overloading a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> with <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>€@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€s have been launched against large commercial web<concept>SERVER</concept>s on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> to disrupt the company’s business and in some cases have brought the company’s commercial activity to a halt.</sentence> <sentence>A €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€ requires the generation of a large number of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s over a brief period of time.</sentence> <sentence>To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> on numerous unsuspecting <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that will generate <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s when a signal is given.</sentence> <sentence>Then, when the signal is given, all of these <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Inherent, then, in €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€s is the availability of unsuspecting <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s to use as accomplices.</sentence> <sentence>This is why all pc users are discouraged from leaving their <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept> when not in use.</sentence> <sentence>It has been estimated that once a pc is connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, at least one intruder will attempt to exploit its existence within 20 minutes.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, an unprotected pc represents a significant threat to the integrity of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Another problem associated with an abundance of unwanted <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s is the proliferation of unwanted junk email, called spam.</sentence> <sentence>However, unlike a €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€, the volume of spam is rarely sufficient to overwhelm the <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam.</sentence> <sentence>This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept>s that might spread viruses and other detrimental <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Protection and cures</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>The old adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over <concept>NETWORK</concept> connections.</sentence> <sentence>A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>, usually with a program called a firewall.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization’s intranet to filter <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s passing in and out of the region.</sentence> <sentence>Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s with certain destination addresses or to block incoming <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.</sentence> <sentence>This latter function is a tool for terminating a €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€ because it provides a means of blocking traffic from the attacking <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Another common role of a firewall at a gateway is to block all incoming <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s that have origin addresses within the region accessed through the gateway because such a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> would indicate that an outsider is pretending to be a member of the inside region.</sentence> <sentence>Masquerading as a party other than one’s self is known as spoofing.</sentence> <sentence>Firewalls are also used to protect individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s rather than entire <concept>NETWORK</concept>s or domains.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> is not being used as a web<concept>SERVER</concept>, a <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>, or an e<concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>, then a firewall should be installed at that <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> is by establishing contact through a “hole” left by a nonexistent <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine <concept>SERVER</concept> on the infected <concept>COMPUTER</concept> by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware’s findings.</sentence> <sentence>A properly installed firewall could block the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from these malicious clients.</sentence> <sentence>Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes—an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.</sentence> <sentence>Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.</sentence> <sentence>Some learn to make this distinction via a training process in which the user identifies items of spam until the filter acquires enough <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s to make decisions on its own.</sentence> <sentence>These filters are <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.</sentence> <sentence>Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is a <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a <concept>SERVER</concept> with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Without a <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>, a client communicates directly with a <concept>SERVER</concept>, meaning that the <concept>SERVER</concept> has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.</sentence> <sentence>Over time, as many clients within an organization’s intranet deal with a distant <concept>SERVER</concept>, that <concept>SERVER</concept> can collect a multitude of information about the intranet’s internal structure—information that can later be used for malicious activity.</sentence> <sentence>To counter this, an organization can establish a <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> for a particular kind of service (<concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, telnet, etc.).</sentence> <sentence>Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a <concept>SERVER</concept> of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>, playing the role of a client, contacts the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>From then on the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> plays the role of an intermediary between the <concept>ACTUAL CLIENT</concept> and the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> by relaying <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s back and forth.</sentence> <sentence>The first advantage of this arrangement is that the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> has no way of knowing that the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is not the true client, and in fact, it is never aware of the <concept>ACTUAL CLIENT</concept>’s existence.</sentence> <sentence>In turn, the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> has no way of learning about the intranet’s internal features.</sentence> <sentence>The second advantage is that the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is in position to filter all the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s sent from the <concept>SERVER</concept> to the client.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, an <concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.</sentence> <sentence>Still another tool for preventing problems in a <concept>NETWORK</concept> environment is auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that is similar to the auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> we learned about in our discussion on <concept>OPERATING SYSTEM</concept> security (section 3.5).</sentence> <sentence>Using <concept>NETWORK</concept> auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in <concept>MESSAGE</concept> traffic at various locations within the administrator’s realm, monitor the activities of the system’s firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in order to detect irregularities.</sentence> <sentence>In effect, auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> is an administrator’s primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.</sentence> <sentence>Another means of defense against invasions via <concept>NETWORK</concept> connections is <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> called antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.</sentence> <sentence>(actually, antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> represents a <concept>BROAD CLASS</concept> of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, whereas many products specialize in virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.) it is important for users of these packages to understand that, just as in the case of biological systems, new <concept>COMPUTER</concept> infections are constantly coming on the scene that require updated vaccines.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> must be routinely maintained by downloading updates from the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>’s vendor.</sentence> <sentence>Even this, however, does not guarantee the safety of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>After all, a new virus must first infect some <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s before it is discovered and a vaccine is produced.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, a wise <concept>COMPUTER</concept> user never opens email attachments from unfamiliar sources, does not download <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> without first confirming its reliability, does not respond to pop-up adds, and does not leave a pc connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept> when such connection is not necessary.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Encryption</strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>In some cases the purpose of <concept>NETWORK</concept> vandalism is to disrupt the system (as in €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€s), but in other cases the ultimate goal is to gain access to information.</sentence> <sentence>The traditional means of protecting information is to control its access through the use of passwords.</sentence> <sentence>However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over <concept>NETWORK</concept>s and <concept>INTERNET</concept>s where <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are relayed by unknown entities.</sentence> <sentence>In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.</sentence> <sentence>Today, many <concept>TRADITIONAL INTERNET</concept> applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called “secure versions” of the applications.</sentence> <sentence>A prime <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> is the secure version of <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, known as https (<concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> over <concept>SECURE SOCKET LAYER</concept>), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to their accounts.</sentence> <sentence>The backbone of <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> over <concept>SECURE SOCKET LAYER</concept> is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (ssl), which was originally developed by netscape to provide secure communication links between web clients and <concept>SERVER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Most <concept>BROWSER</concept>s indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>(some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.) one of the more fascinating topics in the field of encryption is <concept>PUBLICKEY ENCRYPTION</concept>, which involves techniques by which encryption systems are designed so that having knowledge about how <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are encrypted does not allow one to decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>This characteristic is somewhat counterintuitive.</sentence> <sentence>After all, intuition would suggest that if a person knows how <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are encrypted, then that person should be able to reverse the encryption process and thus decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>But <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept>s defy this intuitive logic.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept> involves the use of two values called keys.</sentence> <sentence>One key, known as the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, is used to encrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s; the other key, known as the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>, is required to decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>To use the system, the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> is first distributed to those who might need to send <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to a particular destination.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> is held in confidence at this destination.</sentence> <sentence>Then, the originator of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> can encrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> using the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> and send the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its destination with assurance that its contents are safe, even if it is handled by intermediaries who also know the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, the only party that can decrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is the party at the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept> who holds the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Thus if bob creates a <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept> and gives both alice and carol the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, then both alice and carol can encrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to bob, but they cannot spy on the other’s communication.</sentence> <sentence>Indeed, if carol intercepts a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> from alice, she cannot decrypt it even though she knows how alice encrypted it (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.16).</sentence> <sentence>There are, of course, subtle problems lurking within public-key systems.</sentence> <sentence>One is to ensure that the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> being used is, in fact, the proper key for the destination party.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if you are communicating with your bank, you want to be sure that the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> you are using for encryption is the one for the bank and not an impostor.</sentence> <sentence>If an impostor presents itself as the bank (an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of spoofing) and gives you its <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s you encrypt and send to the “bank” would be meaningful to the impostor and not your bank.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, the task of associating <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>s with correct parties is significant.</sentence> <sentence>One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted <concept>INTERNET</concept> sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>These authorities, acting as <concept>SERVER</concept>s, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.</sentence> <sentence>A certificate is a package containing a party’s name and that party’s <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Many commercial certificate authorities are now available on the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, although it is also common for organizations to maintain their own certificate authorities in order to maintain tighter control over the security of the organization’s communication.</sentence> <sentence>Finally, we should comment on the role <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept>s play in solving problems of authentication—making sure that the author of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is, in fact, the party it claims to be.</sentence> <sentence>The critical point here is that, in some <concept>PUBLICKEY ENCRYPTION</concept> systems, the roles of the encryption and decryption keys can be reversed.</sentence> <sentence>That is, text can be encrypted with the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.</sentence> <sentence>In this manner, the holder of the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> can produce a <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept>, called a <concept>DIGITAL SIGNATURE</concept>, that only that party knows how to produce.</sentence> <sentence>By attaching that signature to a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>, the sender can mark the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> as being authentic.</sentence> <sentence>A <concept>DIGITAL SIGNATURE</concept> can be as simple as the <concept>ENCRYPTED VERSION</concept> of the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> itself.</sentence> <sentence>All the sender must do is encrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> being transmitted using his or her <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> (the key typically used for decrypting).</sentence> <sentence>When the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is received, the receiver uses the sender’s <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> to decrypt the signature.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>MESSAGE</concept> that is revealed is guaranteed to be authentic because only the holder of the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> could have produced the <concept>ENCRYPTED VERSION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>We will return to the topic of <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION</concept> at the end of chapter 12, as an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of a complex <concept>COMPUTER</concept> algorithm.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle><strong>Legal approaches to <concept>NETWORK SECURITY</concept></strong></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence>Another way of enhancing the security of <concept>COMPUTER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing systems is to apply legal remedies.</sentence> <sentence>There are, however, two obstacles to this approach.</sentence> <sentence>The first is that making an action illegal does not preclude the action.</sentence> <sentence>All it does is provide a legal recourse.</sentence> <sentence>The second is that the international nature of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing means that obtaining recourse is often very difficult.</sentence> <sentence>What is illegal in one country might be legal in another.</sentence> <sentence>Ultimately, enhancing <concept>NETWORK SECURITY</concept> by legal means is an international project, and thus must be handled by international legal bodies—a potential player would be the international court of justice in the hague.</sentence> <sentence>Having made these disclaimers, we must admit that, although less than perfect, legal forces still have a tremendous influence, and thus it behooves us to explore some of the legal steps that are being taken to resolve conflicts in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing arena.</sentence> <sentence>For this purpose, we use <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s from the federal laws of the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Similar <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s could be drawn from other government bodies such as the european union.</sentence> <sentence>We begin with the proliferation of malware.</sentence> <sentence>In the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s this problem is addressed by the <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept>, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.</sentence> <sentence>It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.</sentence> <sentence>In short, the act requires proof that the defendant knowingly caused the transmission of a program or data that intentionally caused damage.</sentence> <sentence>The <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept> also covers cases involving the <concept>THEFT OF INFORMATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>In particular, the act outlaws obtaining <concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept> via the <concept>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS</concept> of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>Courts have tended to assign a broad interpretation to the phrase “<concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept>,” and thus the <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept> has been applied to more than the <concept>THEFT OF INFORMATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence>For instance, courts have ruled that the mere use of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> might constitute “<concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept>.” the right of privacy is another, and perhaps the most controversial, <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing issue facing the legal community.</sentence> <sentence>Questions involving an employer’s right to monitor the communications of employees and the extent to which an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> is authorized to access the information being communicated by its clients have been given considerable thought.</sentence> <sentence>In the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s, many of these questions are addressed by the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> (ecpa) of 1986, which has its origins in legislation to control wiretapping.</sentence> <sentence>Although the act is lengthy, its intent is captured in a few short excerpts.</sentence> <sentence>In particular, it states that except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept> .</sentence> <sentence>Shall be punished as provided in subsection (4) or shall be subject to suit as provided in subsection (5).</sentence> <sentence>And .</sentence> <sentence>Any person or entity providing an <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept> service to the public shall not intentionally divulge the contents of any communication .</sentence> <sentence>On that service to any person or entity other than an addressee or intended recipient of <concept>SUCH COMMUNICATION</concept> or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient.</sentence> <sentence>In brief, the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> confirms an individual’s right to private communication—it is illegal for an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to release information about the communication of its clients, and it is illegal for unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop on another’s communication.</sentence> <sentence>But the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> leaves room for debate.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the question regarding the rights of an employer to monitor the communication of employees becomes a question of authorization, which courts have tended to grant to employers when the communication is carried out using the employer’s equipment.</sentence> <sentence>Moreover, the act goes on to give some government agencies authority to monitor <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept>s under certain restrictions.</sentence> <sentence>These provisions have been the source of much debate.</sentence> <sentence>For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in 2000 the fbi revealed the existence of its system, called carnivore, that reports on the communication of all subscribers of an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> rather than just a court-designated target, and in 2001 in response to the terrorist attack on the world trade center, congress passed the controversial usa patriot (uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism) act that modified the restrictions under which government agencies must operate.</sentence> <sentence>In 2013, it was subsequently revealed that these laws had been interpreted to authorize the collection of vast amounts of telephone and <concept>INTERNET</concept> usage data on ordinary americans indiscriminately.</sentence> <sentence>In addition to the legal and ethical controversies raised by these developments, providing monitoring rights raises some technical problems that are more pertinent to our study.</sentence> <sentence>One is that to provide these capabilities, a communication system must be constructed and programmed so that communications can be monitored.</sentence> <sentence>To establish such capabilities was the goal of the communications assistance for <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> act (calea).</sentence> <sentence>It requires telecommunication carriers to modify their equipment to accommodate <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> taps—a requirement that has been complex and expensive to meet.</sentence> <sentence>Another controversial issue involves the clash between the government’s right to monitor communications and the public’s right to use encryption.</sentence> <sentence>If the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s being monitored are well encrypted, then tapping the communication is of limited value to <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> agencies.</sentence> <sentence>Governments in the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s, canada, and europe are considering systems that would require the registration of ciphering keys, but such demands are being fought by corporations.</sentence> <sentence>After all, due to corporate espionage it is understandable that requiring the registration of ciphering keys would make many law-abiding corporations, as well as citizens, uncomfortable.</sentence> <sentence>How secure can the registration system be? finally, as a means of recognizing the scope of legal issues surrounding the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, we cite the <concept>ANTICYBERSQUATTING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</concept> of 1999 that is designed to protect organizations from impostors who might otherwise establish look-alike <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s (a practice known as cybersquatting).</sentence> <sentence>The act prohibits the use of <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s that are identical or confusingly similar to another’s trademark or “common law trademark.” one effect is that although the act does not outlaw <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> speculation (the process of registering potentially desirable <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s and later selling the rights to that name), it limits the practice to generic <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence>Thus, a <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> speculator might legally register a generic name such as greatusedcars.com but might not be able to claim rights to the name bigalusedcars.com if big al is already in the used car business.</sentence> <sentence>Such distinctions are often the subject of debate in lawsuits based on the <concept>ANTICYBERSQUATTING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</concept>.</sentence></section></chapter>
