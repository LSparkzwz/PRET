resources among different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s has led to linked <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept>s, called <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, in which <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are connected so that data can be transferred from <concept>MACHINE</concept> to <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_1">In these <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>COMPUTER</concept> users can exchange <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s and share resources—such as printing capabilities, <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> packages, and data storage facilities—that are scattered throughout the

<concept>NETWORK SOFTWARE</concept> that provides a sophisticated <concept>NETWORK</concept>-wide infrastructure.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_3">In a sense, <concept>NETWORK SOFTWARE</concept> is

being either a <concept>PERSONAL AREA NETWORK</concept> (pan), a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept> (lan), a <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept> (man), or a <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept> (wan).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_7">A <concept>PERSONAL AREA NETWORK</concept> is normally used for shortrange communications—typically less than a few meters—such as between a wireless headset and a smartphone or between a wireless mouse and its pc.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_8">In contrast, a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept> normally consists of a collection of <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a single building or building complex.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_9">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s on a university campus or those in a manufacturing plant might be connected by a <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_10">A <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept> is a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_11">Finally, a <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept> links <concept>MACHINE</concept>s over a greater distance—perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_12">Another means of classifying <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is based on whether the <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_13">A <concept>NETWORK</concept> of the former type is called an <concept>OPEN NETWORK</concept>; a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_14"><concept>OPEN NETWORK</concept> designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_15">The <concept>INTERNET</concept> (a popular worldwide <concept>NETWORK</concept> of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s that we will study in this chapter) is an <concept>OPEN SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_16">In particular, communication throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is governed by an open collection of standards known as the <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>/<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> protocol suite, which is the subject of section 4.4.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_17">Anyone is free to use these standards without paying fees or signing license agreements.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_18">In contrast, a company such as novell inc.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_19">Might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing these products.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_20">Still another way of classifying <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is based on the topology of the <concept>NETWORK</concept>, which refers to the pattern in which the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are connected.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_21">Two of the more popular topologies are the bus, in which the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are all connected to a common communication line called a bus (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1a), and the star, in which one <concept>MACHINE</concept> serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1b).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_22">The bus topology was popularized in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards known as ethernet, and <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>s remain one of the most popular <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing systems in use today.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_23">The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_24">It evolved from the paradigm of a large central <concept>COMPUTER</concept> serving many users.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_25">As the simple terminals employed by these users grew into small <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s themselves, a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> emerged.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_26">Today, the star configuration is popular in wireless <concept>NETWORK</concept>s where communication is conducted by means of radio broadcast and the central <concept>MACHINE</concept>, called the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> (ap), serves as a focal point around which all communication is coordinated.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_27">The difference between a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> and a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> is not always obvious by the physical arrangement of equipment.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_28">The distinction is whether the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept> envision themselves as communicating directly with each other over a common bus or indirectly through an intermediary central <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_29">For instance, a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> might not appear as a long bus from which <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are connected over short links as depicted in <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.1.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_30">Instead, it may have a very <concept>SHORT BUS</concept> with long links to the individual <concept>MACHINE</concept>s, meaning that the <concept>NETWORK</concept> would look more like a star.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_31">Indeed, sometimes a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> is created by running links from each <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to a central location where they are connected to a device called a hub.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_32">This hub is little more than a very <concept>SHORT BUS</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_33">All it does is relay any signal it receives (with perhaps some amplification) back out to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s connected to it.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_34">The result is a <concept>NETWORK</concept> that looks like a <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept> although it operates like a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_35">Protocols for a <concept>NETWORK</concept> to function reliably, it is important to establish rules by which activities are conducted.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_36">Such rules are called protocols.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_37">By developing and adopting protocol standards, vendors are able to build products for <concept>NETWORK</concept> applications that are compatible with products from other vendors.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_38">Thus, the development of protocol standards is an indispensable process in the development of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing technologies.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_39">As an introduction to the protocol concept, let us consider the problem of coordinating the transmission of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s among <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_40">Without rules governing this communication, all the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s might insist on transmitting <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s at the same time or fail to assist other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s when that assistance is required.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_41">In a <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> based on the ethernet standards, the right to transmit <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s is controlled by the protocol known as <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, <concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept> (csma/cd).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_42">This protocol dictates that each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> be broadcast to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s on the bus (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.2).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_43">Each <concept>MACHINE</concept> monitors all the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s but keeps only those addressed to itself.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_44">To transmit a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>, a <concept>MACHINE</concept> waits until the bus is silent, and at this time it begins transmitting while continuing to monitor the bus.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_45">If another <concept>MACHINE</concept> also begins transmitting, both <concept>MACHINE</concept>s detect the clash and pause for a brief, independently random period of time before trying to transmit again.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_46">The result is a system similar to that used by a small group of people in a conversation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_47">If two people start to talk at once, they both stop.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_48">The difference is that people might go through a series such as, “i’m sorry, what were you going to say?”, “no, no.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_49">You go first,” whereas under the <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€ protocol each <concept>MACHINE</concept> merely tries again later.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_50">Note that <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€ is not compatible with wireless <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept>s in which all <concept>MACHINE</concept>s communicate through a <concept>CENTRAL ACCESS POINT</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_51">This is because a <concept>MACHINE</concept> may be unable to detect that its transmissions are colliding with those of another.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_52">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> may not hear the other because its own signal drowns out that of the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_53">Another cause might be that the signals from the different <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are blocked from each other by objects or distance even though they can all communicate with the <concept>CENTRAL ACCESS POINT</concept> (a condition known as the <concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM</concept>, <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.3).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_54">The result is that wireless <concept>NETWORK</concept>s adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_55">Such policies are classified as <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept></concept>#€ (csma/ca), many of which are standardized by ieee (see the sidebar “institute of electrical and electronics engineers” in chapter 7) within the protocols defined in ieee 802.11 and commonly referred to as wifi.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_56">We emphasize that <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept> protocols are designed to avoid collisions and may not eliminate them completely.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_57">When collisions do occur, <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s must be retransmitted.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_58">The most common approach to <concept>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</concept> is based on giving advantage to <concept>MACHINE</concept>s that have already been waiting for an opportunity to transmit.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_59">The protocol used is similar to ethernet’s <concept>CARRIER SENSE</concept>, €@<concept class="nested"><concept>MULTIPLE ACCESS</concept> WITH <concept>COLLISION DETECTION</concept></concept>#€.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_60">The basic difference is that when a <concept>MACHINE</concept> first needs to transmit a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and finds the communication channel silent, it does not start transmitting immediately.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_61">Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only if the channel has remained silent throughout that period.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_62">If a <concept>BUSY CHANNEL</concept> is experienced during this process, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> waits for a randomly determined period before trying again.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_63">Once this period is exhausted, the <concept>MACHINE</concept> is allowed to claim a <concept>SILENT CHANNEL</concept> without hesitation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_64">This means that collisions between “newcomers” and those that have already been waiting are avoided because a “newcomer” is not allowed to claim a <concept>SILENT CHANNEL</concept> until any <concept>MACHINE</concept> that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_65">This protocol, however, does not solve the <concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL PROBLEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_66">After all, any protocol based on distinguishing between a silent or <concept>BUSY CHANNEL</concept> requires that each individual station be able to hear all the others.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_67">To solve this problem, some <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s require that each <concept>MACHINE</concept> send a short “request” <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and wait until the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> acknowledges that request before transmitting an entire <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_68">If the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> is busy because it is dealing with a “<concept>HIDDEN TERMINAL</concept>,” it will ignore the request, and the requesting <concept>MACHINE</concept> will know to wait.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_69">Otherwise, the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> will acknowledge the request, and the <concept>MACHINE</concept> will know that it is safe to transmit.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_70">Note that all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept> will hear all acknowledgments sent from the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and thus have a good idea of whether the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> is busy at any given time, even though they may not be able to hear the transmissions taking place.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle id="subsection_4.1.2_title">Combining <concept>NETWORK</concept>s</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_71">Sometimes it is necessary to connect existing <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form an extended communication system.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_72">This can be done by connecting the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form a larger version of the same “type” of <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_73">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in the case of <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept>s based on the ethernet protocols, it is often possible to connect the buses to form a single long bus.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_74">This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters, bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_75">The simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.4a).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_76">A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_77">Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s across the connection.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_78">Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and forwards a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> across the connection only when that <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is destined for a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> on the <concept>OTHER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_79">Thus, two <concept>MACHINE</concept>s residing on the same side of a bridge can exchange <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s without interfering with communication taking place on the <concept>OTHER SIDE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_80">A bridge produces a more <concept>EFFICIENT SYSTEM</concept> than that produced by a repeater.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_81">A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_82">Thus, a switch produces a <concept>NETWORK</concept> consisting of several buses extending from the switch as spokes on a wheel (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.4b).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_83">As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s and forwards only those <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s destined for other spokes.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_84">Moreover, each <concept>MESSAGE</concept> that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_85">It is important to note that when <concept>NETWORK</concept>s are connected via repeaters, bridges, and switches, the result is a single large <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_86">The entire system operates in the same manner (using the same protocols) as each of the original smaller <concept>NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_87">Sometimes, however, the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to be connected have incompatible characteristics.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_88">For instance, the characteristics of a <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept> are not readily compatible with an <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_89">In these cases the <concept>NETWORK</concept>s must be connected in a manner that builds a <concept>NETWORK</concept> of <concept>NETWORK</concept>s, known as an <concept>INTERNET</concept>, in which the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s maintain their individuality and continue to function as autonomous <concept>NETWORK</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_90">(note that the generic term <concept>INTERNET</concept> is distinct from the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_91">The <concept>INTERNET</concept>, written with an uppercase i, refers to a particular, <concept>WORLDWIDE INTERNET</concept> that we will study in later sections of this chapter.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_92">There are many other <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s of <concept>INTERNET</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_93">Indeed, <concept>TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION</concept> was handled by <concept>WORLDWIDE INTERNET</concept> systems well before the <concept>INTERNET</concept> was popularized.) the connection between <concept>NETWORK</concept>s to form an <concept>INTERNET</concept> is handled by devices known as routers, which are special purpose <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s used for forwarding <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_94">Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters, bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between <concept>NETWORK</concept>s while allowing each <concept>NETWORK</concept> to maintain its unique internal characteristics.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_95">As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, <concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.5 depicts two wifi <concept>STAR NETWORK</concept>s and an ethernet <concept>BUS NETWORK</concept> connected by routers.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_96">When a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in one of the <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s wants to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in the <concept>ETHERNET NETWORK</concept>, it first sends the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> in its <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_97">From there, the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> sends the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its associated router, and this router forwards the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to the router at the ethernet.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_98">There the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is given to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> on the bus, and that <concept>MACHINE</concept> then forwards the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its <concept>FINAL DESTINATION</concept> in the ethernet.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_99">The reason that routers are so named is that their purpose is to forward <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s in their <concept>PROPER DIRECTION</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_100">This forwarding process is based on an <concept>INTERNET</concept>wide addressing system in which all the devices in an <concept>INTERNET</concept> (including the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s and the routers) are assigned unique addresses.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_101">(thus, each <concept>MACHINE</concept> in one of the original <concept>NETWORK</concept>s has two addresses: its original “local” address within its <concept>OWN NETWORK</concept> and its <concept>INTERNET</concept> address.) a <concept>MACHINE</concept> wanting to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a <concept>MACHINE</concept> in a distant <concept>NETWORK</concept> attaches the <concept>INTERNET</concept> address of the destination to the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> and directs the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its local router.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_102">From there it is forwarded in the <concept>PROPER DIRECTION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_103">For this forwarding purpose, each router maintains a <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> that contains the router’s knowledge about the direction in which <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s should be sent depending on their destination addresses.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_104">The “point” at which one <concept>NETWORK</concept> is linked to an <concept>INTERNET</concept> is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the <concept>NETWORK</concept> and the outside world.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_105">Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_106">In many cases a <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_107">In other cases the <concept>TERM GATEWAY</concept> may be used to refer to more than just a router.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_108">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in most residential <concept>WIFI NETWORK</concept>s that are connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, the <concept>TERM GATEWAY</concept> refers collectively to both the <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> and the router connected to the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Methods of process communication</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_109">The various activities (or processes) executing on the different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s within a <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or even executing on the <concept>SAME MACHINE</concept> via time-sharing/multitasking) must often communicate with each other to coordinate their actions and to perform their designated tasks.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_110"><concept>SUCH COMMUNICATION</concept> between processes is called <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_111">A popular convention used for <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept> is the client/ <concept>SERVER</concept> model.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_112">This model defines the basic roles played by the processes as either a client, which makes requests of other processes, or a <concept>SERVER</concept>, which satisfies the requests made by clients.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_113">An <concept>EARLY APPLICATION</concept> of the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> appeared in <concept>NETWORK</concept>s connecting all the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in a cluster of offices.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_114">In this situation, a single, highquality printer was attached to the <concept>NETWORK</concept> where it was available to all the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_115">In this case the printer played the role of a <concept>SERVER</concept> (often called a <concept>PRINT SERVER</concept>), and the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s were programmed to play the role of clients that sent print requests to the <concept>PRINT SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_116">Another <concept>EARLY APPLICATION</concept> of the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> was used to reduce the cost of <concept>MAGNETIC DISK</concept> storage while also removing the need for duplicate copies of records.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_117">Here one <concept>MACHINE</concept> in a <concept>NETWORK</concept> was equipped with a high-capacity <concept>MASS STORAGE</concept> system (usually a <concept>MAGNETIC DISK</concept>) that contained all of an organization’s records.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_118">Other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> then requested access to the records as they needed them.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_119">Thus the <concept>MACHINE</concept> that actually contained the records played the role of a <concept>SERVER</concept> (called a <concept>FILE SERVER</concept>), and the other <concept>MACHINE</concept>s played the role of clients that requested access to the files that were stored at the <concept>FILE SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_120">Today the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> is used extensively in <concept>NETWORK</concept> applications, as we will see later in this chapter.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_121">However, the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> is not the only means of <concept>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_122">Another model is the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated p2p) model.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_123">Whereas the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> involves one process (the <concept>SERVER</concept>) providing a service to numerous others (clients), the peer-topeer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.6).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_124">Moreover, whereas a <concept>SERVER</concept> must execute continuously so that it is prepared to serve its clients at any time, the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_125">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, applications of the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> include <concept>INSTANT MESSAGING</concept> in which people carry on a written conversation over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as well as situations in which people play competitive interactive games.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_126">The <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is also a popular means of distributing files such as music recordings and motion pictures via the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_127">In this case, one peer may receive a file from another and then provide that file to other peers.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_128">The collection of peers participating in such a distribution is sometimes called a swarm.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_129">The swarm approach to file distribution is in contrast to earlier approaches that applied the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> by establishing a central distribution center (the <concept>SERVER</concept>) from which clients downloaded files (or at least found sources for those files).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_130">One reason that the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is replacing the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> for file sharing is that it distributes the service task over many peers rather than concentrating it at one <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_131">This lack of a centralized base of operation leads to a more <concept>EFFICIENT SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_132">Unfortunately, another reason for the popularity of file distribution systems based on the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> is that, in cases of questionable legality, the lack of a <concept>CENTRAL SERVER</concept> makes legal efforts to enforce copyright laws more difficult.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_133">There are numerous cases, however, in which individuals have discovered that “difficult” does not mean “impossible” and have found themselves faced with significant liabilities due to copyright infringement violations.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_134">You might often read or hear the <concept>TERM PEER-TO-PEER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>, which is an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of how misuse of terminology can evolve when technical terms are adopted by the nontechnical community.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_135">The <concept>TERM PEER-TO-PEER</concept> refers to a system by which two processes communicate over a <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or <concept>INTERNET</concept>).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_136">It is not a property of the <concept>NETWORK</concept> (or <concept>INTERNET</concept>).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_137">A process might use the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> to communicate with another process and later use the <concept>CLIENT/<concept>SERVER</concept> MODEL</concept> to communicate with another process over the same <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_138">Thus, it would be more accurate to speak of communicating by means of the <concept>PEER-TO-PEER MODEL</concept> rather than communicating over a peer-to-peer <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Distributed systems</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_139">With the success of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing technology, interaction between <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s via <concept>NETWORK</concept>s has become common and multifaceted.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_140">Many modern <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, <concept>COMPUTER</concept> games, and even the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that controls a <concept>NETWORK</concept>’s infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that they consist of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> units that execute as processes on different <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_141">Early distributed systems were developed independently from scratch.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_142">But today, research is revealing a common infrastructure running throughout these systems, including such things as communication and security systems.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_143">In turn, efforts have been made to produce prefabricated systems that provide this basic infrastructure and therefore allow distributed applications to be constructed by merely developing the part of the system that is unique to the application.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_144">Several types of distributed computing systems are now common.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_145">Cluster computing describes a distributed system in which many independent <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s work closely together to provide computation or services comparable to a much larger <concept>MACHINE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_146">The cost of these individual <concept>MACHINE</concept>s, plus the high-speed <concept>NETWORK</concept> to connect them, can be less than a higher-priced super<concept>COMPUTER</concept>, but with higher reliability and lower maintenance costs.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_147">Such distributed systems are used to provide high-availability—because it is more likely that at least one member of the cluster will be able to answer a request, even if other cluster members break down or are unavailable—and load-balancing—because the workload can be shifted automatically from members of the cluster that have too much to do to those that may have too little.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_148">Grid computing refers to distributed systems that are more loosely coupled than clusters but that still work together to accomplish large tasks.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_149">Grid computing can involve specialized <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> to make it easier to distribute data and algorithms to the <concept>MACHINE</concept>s participating in a grid.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_150"><concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s include university of wisconsin’s condor system, or berkeley’s open infrastructure for <concept>NETWORK</concept> computing (boinc).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_151">Both of these systems are often installed on <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that are used for other purposes, such as pcs at work or at home, that can then volunteer computing power to the grid when the <concept>MACHINE</concept> is not otherwise being used.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_152">Enabled by the growing connectivity of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, this type of voluntary, distributed grid computing has enabled millions of home pcs to work on enormously complex mathematical and scientific problems.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_153">Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s on the <concept>NETWORK</concept> can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_154">Much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is making it possible for entities to entrust their data and computations to “the cloud,” which in this case refers to the enormous computing resources already available on the <concept>NETWORK</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_155">Services such as amazon’s elastic compute cloud allow clients to rent virtual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s by the hour, without concern for where the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> hardware is actually located.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_156">Google drive and google apps allow users to collaborate on information or build web services without needing to know how many <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s are working on the problem or where the relevant data are stored.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_157">Cloud computing services provide reasonable guarantees of reliability and scalability, but also raise concerns about privacy and security in a world where we may no longer know who owns and operates the <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that we use.</sentence></section></br></br><section><sectionTitle>4.2 The <concept>INTERNET</concept></sectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_158">The most notable <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of an

goal was to develop the ability to link a variety of <concept>COMPUTER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>s so that they could function as a connected system that would not be disrupted by local

<concept>TIER-2 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept></concept> is often a matter of opinion.) again, these <concept>NETWORK</concept>s tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_173">Tier-1 and <concept>TIER-2 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept></concept> are essentially <concept>NETWORK</concept>s of routers that collectively

<sentence id="sent_175">Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or tier-3 <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_176">An <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> is essentially an independent <concept>INTERNET</concept>, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a <concept>SINGLE AUTHORITY</concept> that is in the business of supplying <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to individual homes and businesses.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_177"><concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s include cable and telephone companies that charge for their service as well as organizations such as universities or corporations that take it upon themselves to provide <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to individuals within their organizations.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_178">The devices that individual users connect to the <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>s are known as <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s or

automobiles, and home appliances.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_180">After all, the <concept>INTERNET</concept> is essentially a communications system, and thus any device that would benefit from communicating with other devices is a potential <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_181">The technology by which <concept>END SYSTEM</concept>s connect to larger <concept>NETWORK</concept>s is also varied.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_182">Perhaps the fastest growing are wireless connections based on wifi technology.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_183">The strategy is to connect the <concept>ACCESS POINT</concept> to an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> and thus provide <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> through that <concept>INTERNET

<sentence id="sent_185">Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_186">A

id="sent_189">The goal is to conduct research in <concept>INTERNET</concept> applications requiring high bandwidth communication, such as remote access and control of costly state-of-the-art equipment such as telescopes and medical diagnostic devices.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_190">An <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of current research involves remote surgery performed by robot hands that mimic the

http://www.<concept>INTERNET</concept>2.org..</sentence> <sentence id="sent_192">Other popular techniques for connecting to <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s use telephone lines or cable/satellite systems.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_193">These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> or to a customer’s router to which multiple

satellite <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_196">Modern <concept>NETWORK</concept>s can be designed to carry digital data directly between <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s, but older, analog <concept>NETWORK</concept> infrastructure still comprises a significant portion of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_197">Issues arising from these <concept>LEGACY ANALOG</concept> linkages are often referred to collectively as the last mile problem.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_198">The main arteries of <concept>WIDE AREA NETWORK</concept>s, <concept>METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK</concept>s, and many <concept>LOCAL AREA NETWORK</concept>s are relatively easy to modernize with high-speed digital technology such as fiber optics, but it can be far costlier to replace the existing copper telephone lines and coaxial cables that connect these arteries to each individual home or office.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_199">Thus, information that originated on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> continents away from an <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> may spend almost its entire trip on high-speed digital connections, only to traverse the “last mile” to the <concept>END SYSTEM</concept> over a slow, century-old analog phone line.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_200">As alluded to in chapter 2, several clever schemes have been developed to extend these <concept>LEGACY ANALOG</concept> links to accommodate transmission of digital data.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_201">Dsl modems, cable modems, satellite uplinks, and even direct fiber-optic connections to the home are used to bring

id="sent_202">As we learned in section 4.1, an <concept>INTERNET</concept> needs an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide addressing system that assigns a unique identifying address to each <concept>COMPUTER</concept> in the system.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_203">In the <concept>INTERNET</concept> these addresses are known as <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_204">(the term <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> refers to “<concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>,” which is a term we will learn more about in section 4.4.) originally, each <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> was a pattern of 32 bits, but to provide a larger set of addresses, the process of converting to 128-bit addresses is currently underway (see the discussion of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>v6 in section 4.4).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_205">Blocks of consecutively numbered <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es are awarded to <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> by the €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers (icann), which is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s operation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_206">The <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to <concept>MACHINE</concept>s within their region of authority.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_207">Thus, <concept>MACHINE</concept>s throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept> are assigned unique <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_208"><concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation in which the bytes of the address are separated by periods and each byte is expressed as an integer represented in traditional base 10 notation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_209">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, using dotted decimal notation, the pattern 5.2 would represent the two-byte <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> 0000010100000010, which consists of the byte 00000101 (represented by 5) followed by the byte 00000010 (represented by 2), and the pattern 17.12.25 would represent the three-byte <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> consisting of the byte 00010001 (which is 17 written in binary notation), followed by the byte 00001100 (12 written in binary), followed by the byte 00011001 (25 written in binary).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_210">In summary, a 32-bit <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> might appear as 192.207.177.133 when expressed in dotted decimal notation.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_211">Addresses in bit-pattern form (even when compressed using dotted decimal notation) are rarely conducive to human consumption.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_212">For this reason the <concept>INTERNET</concept> has an alternative addressing system in which <concept>MACHINE</concept>s are identified by mnemonic names.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_213">This addressing system is based on the concept of a domain, which can be thought of as a “region” of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> operated by a <concept>SINGLE AUTHORITY</concept> such as a university, club, company, or <concept>GOVERNMENT AGENCY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_214">(the word region is in quotations here because, as we will soon see, such a region may not correspond to a physical area of the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.) each domain must be registered with €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers—a process handled by companies, called registrars, that have been assigned this role by €@<concept class="nested"><concept>INTERNET CORPORATION</concept> FOR <concept>ASSIGNED NAME</concept></concept>#€s and numbers.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_215">As a part of this registration process, the domain is assigned a <concept>MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME</concept>, which is unique among all the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s throughout the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_216"><concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s are often descriptive of the organization registering the domain, which enhances their utility for humans.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_217">As an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> of <concept>MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY</concept> is mu.edu.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_218">Note the suffix following the period.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_219">It is used to reflect the domain’s classification, which in this case is “educational” as indicated by the edu suffix.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_220">These suffixes are called top-level domains (tlds).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_221">Other top-level domains include com for commercial institutions, gov for <concept>US GOVERNMENT</concept> institutions, org for nonprofit organizations, museum for museums, info for unrestricted use, and net, which was originally intended for <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept> but is now used on a much broader scale.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_222">In addition to these general top-level domains, there are also two-letter top-level domains for specific countries (called country-code top-level domains) such as au for australia and ca for canada.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_223">Once a domain’s mnemonic name is registered, the organization that registered the name is free to extend the name to obtain mnemonic identifiers for individual items within the domain.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_224">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, an individual host within <concept>MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY</concept> may be identified as eagle.mu.edu.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_225">Note that <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s are extended to the left and separated by a period.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_226">In some cases multiple extensions, called subdomains, are used as a means of organizing the names within a domain.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_227">These subdomains often represent different <concept>NETWORK</concept>s within the domain’s jurisdiction.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_228">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if yoyodyne corporation was assigned the <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> yoyodyne.com, then an individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept> at yoyodyne might have a name such as overthruster.propulsion.yoyodyne.com, meaning that the <concept>COMPUTER</concept> overthruster is in the subdomain propulsion within the domain yoyodyne within the top-level domain com.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_229">(we should emphasize that the dotted notation used in <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>es is not related to the dotted decimal notation used to represent addresses in <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept> form.) although <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>es are convenient for humans, <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are always transferred over the <concept>INTERNET</concept> by means of <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept>es.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_230">Thus, if a human wants to send a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to a distant <concept>MACHINE</concept> and identifies the destination by means of a <concept>MNEMONIC ADDRESS</concept>, the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> being used must be able to convert that address into an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS</concept> before transmitting the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_231">This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous <concept>SERVER</concept>s, called <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>s, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_232">Collectively, these <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>s are used as an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide directory system known as the <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> (dns).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_233">The process of using <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> to perform a translation is called a <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookup.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_234">Thus, for a <concept>MACHINE</concept> to be accessible by means of a <concept>MNEMONIC DOMAIN NAME</concept>, that name must be represented in a <concept>NAME SERVER</concept> within the <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_235">In those cases in which the entity establishing the domain has the resources, it can establish and maintain its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept> containing all the names within that domain.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_236">Indeed, this is the model on which the domain system was originally based.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_237">Each registered domain represented a physical region of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> that was operated by a local authority such as a company, university, or <concept>GOVERNMENT AGENCY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_238">This authority was essentially an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> that provided <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to its members by means of its own intranet that was linked to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_239">As part of this system, the organization maintained its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept> that provided translation services for all the names used within its domain.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_240">This model is still common today.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_241">However, many individuals or small organizations want to establish a domain presence on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> without committing the resources necessary to support it.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_242">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, it might be beneficial for a local chess club to have a presence on the <concept>INTERNET</concept> as kingsandqueens.org, but the club would likely not have the resources to establish its <concept>OWN NETWORK</concept>, maintain a link from this <concept>NETWORK</concept> to the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, and implement its <concept>OWN NAME SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_243">In this case, the club can contract with an <concept>ACCESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to create the appearance of a registered domain using the resources already established by the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_244">Typically, the club, perhaps with the assistance of the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>, registers the name chosen by the club and contracts with the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to have that name included in the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_245">This means that all <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookups regarding the new <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> will be directed to the <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept>’s <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>, from which the proper translation will be obtained.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_246">In this way, many registered

standards are designed to have wideranging applications.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_402">Rather than designing individual, unrelated markup languages for encoding various types of documents, the approach represented by <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> is to develop a standard for markup languages in general.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_403">With this standard, markup languages can be developed for various applications.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_404">Markup languages developed in this manner possess a uniformity that allows them to be combined to obtain markup languages for complex applications such as <concept>TEXT DOCUMENT</concept>s that contain segments of <concept>SHEET MUSIC</concept> and mathematical expressions.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_405">Finally, we should note that <concept>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> allows the development of new markup languages that differ from <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> in that they emphasize semantics rather than appearance.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_406">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, with <concept>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</concept> the ingredients in a recipe can be marked so that they appear as a list in which each ingredient is positioned on a separate line.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_407">But if we used semantic-oriented tags, ingredients in a recipe could be marked as ingredients (perhaps using the tags &lt;ingredient&gt; and </ ingredient>) rather than merely items in a list.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_408">The difference is subtle but important.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_409">The semantic approach would allow <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept>s (websites that assist users in locating web material pertaining to a subject of interest) to identify recipes that contain or do not contain certain ingredients, which would be a substantial improvement over the current state of the art in which only recipes that do or do not contain certain words can be isolated.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_410">More precisely, if semantic tags are used, a <concept>SEARCH ENGINE</concept> can identify recipes for lasagna that do not contain spinach, whereas a similar search based merely on word content would skip over a recipe that started with the statement “this lasagna does not contain spinach.” in turn, by using an <concept>INTERNET</concept>-wide standard for marking documents according to semantics rather than appearance, a world wide semantic web, rather than the world wide syntactic web we have today, would be created.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Client-side and <concept>SERVER</concept>-side activities</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_411">Consider now the steps that would be required

flow of other <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s at the <concept>INTERNET</concept> routers where numerous <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s cross paths.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_477">Indeed, small segments of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s can interweave at these points, whereas a long <concept>MESSAGE</concept> forces others to wait while it passes (much like cars waiting for a long train to pass at a

<concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_482">It is the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>’s job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet’s path through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_483">In fact, the combination of the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> and the <concept>LINK LAYER</concept> below it

that €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€s at the origin and destination work together by means of acknowledgments and packet retransmissions to assure that all segments of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> are successfully transferred to the destination.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_534">For this reason <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> is called a reliable protocol, whereas <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept>, which does not offer such retransmission services, is said to be an unreliable protocol.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_535">Still another distinction between <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> and <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is that <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> provides for both flow control, meaning that a €@<concept class="nested"><concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept></concept>#€ at a <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept> can reduce the rate at which it transmits segments to keep from overwhelming its counterpart at the destination, as well as

can adjust its transmission rate to alleviate congestion between it and the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_536">All this does not mean that <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is a poor choice.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_537">After all, a <concept>TRANSPORT LAYER</concept> based on <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> is more streamlined than a layer based on <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept>, and thus if an application is prepared to handle the potential consequences of <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept>, that option might be the better choice.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_538">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the efficiency of <concept>USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL</concept> makes it the protocol of choice for <concept>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM</concept> lookups and <concept>VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_539">However, because email is less time sensitive, <concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>s use <concept>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</concept> to transfer email.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_540"><concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> is the <concept>INTERNET</concept>’s standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_541">We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, and routing, which involves updating the layer’s <concept>FORWARDING TABLE</concept> to reflect changing conditions.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_542">For instance, a router may malfunction, meaning that traffic should no longer be forwarded in its direction, or a section of the <concept>INTERNET</concept> may become congested, meaning that traffic should be routed around the blockage.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_543">Much of the <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL</concept> standard associated with routing deals with the protocols used for communication among neighboring <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept>s as they interchange routing information.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_544">An interesting feature associated with forwarding is that each time an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept></concept> at a <concept>MESSAGE 'S ORIGIN</concept> prepares a packet, it appends a value called a <concept>HOP COUNT</concept>, or time to live, to that packet.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_545">This value is a limit to the number of times the packet should be forwarded as it tries to find its way through the <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_546">Each time an <concept>INTERNET PROTOCOL <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept></concept> forwards a packet, it decrements that packet’s <concept>HOP COUNT</concept> by one.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_547">With this information, the <concept>NETWORK LAYER</concept> can protect the <concept>INTERNET</concept> from packets circling endlessly within the system.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_548">Although the <concept>INTERNET</concept> continues to grow on a daily basis, an initial <concept>HOP COUNT</concept> of 64 remains more than sufficient to allow a packet to find its way through the maze of routers within today’s <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_549">For years a version of

<sentence id="sent_570">A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm’s replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire <concept>NETWORK</concept> or <concept>INTERNET</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_571">A <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept> is a program that enters a <concept>COMPUTER SYSTEM</concept>

explicitly by simply asking for it.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_582">The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous “lines” in hopes that someone

some cases have brought the company’s commercial activity to a halt.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_589">A €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€ requires the generation of a large number of <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s over a brief period of time.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_590">To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> on numerous unsuspecting <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s that will generate <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s when a signal is given.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_591">Then, when the signal is given, all of these <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_592">Inherent, then, in €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL

<sentence id="sent_599">This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating <concept>TROJAN HORSE</concept>s that might spread viruses and other detrimental <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Protection and cures</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_600">The old adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is certainly true in the context of controlling vandalism over <concept>NETWORK</concept> connections.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_601">A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>, usually with a program called a firewall.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_602">For instance, a firewall might be installed at the gateway of an organization’s intranet to filter <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s passing in and out of the region.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_603">Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s with certain destination addresses or to block incoming <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_604">This latter function is a tool for terminating a €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€ because it provides a means of blocking traffic from the attacking <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_605">Another common role of a firewall at a gateway is to block all incoming <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s that have origin addresses within the region accessed through the gateway because such a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> would indicate that an outsider is pretending to be a member of the inside region.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_606">Masquerading as a party other than one’s self is known as spoofing.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_607">Firewalls are also used to protect individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s rather than entire <concept>NETWORK</concept>s or domains.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_608">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> is not being used as a web<concept>SERVER</concept>, a <concept>NAME SERVER</concept>, or an e<concept>MAIL SERVER</concept>, then a firewall should be installed at that <concept>COMPUTER</concept> to block all incoming traffic addressed to such applications.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_609">Indeed, one way an intruder might gain entry to a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> is by establishing contact through a “hole” left by a nonexistent <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_610">In particular, one method for retrieving information gathered by spyware is to establish a clandestine <concept>SERVER</concept> on the infected <concept>COMPUTER</concept> by which malicious clients can retrieve the spyware’s findings.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_611">A properly installed firewall could block the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s from these malicious clients.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_612">Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes—an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_613">Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between desirable email and spam.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_614">Some learn to make this distinction via a training process in which the user identifies items of spam until the filter acquires enough <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s to make decisions on its own.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_615">These filters are <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_616">Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_617">A <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is a <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a <concept>SERVER</concept> with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the <concept>SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_618">Without a <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>, a client communicates directly with a <concept>SERVER</concept>, meaning that the <concept>SERVER</concept> has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_619">Over time, as many clients within an organization’s intranet deal with a distant <concept>SERVER</concept>, that <concept>SERVER</concept> can collect a multitude of information about the intranet’s internal structure—information that can later be used for malicious activity.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_620">To counter this, an organization can establish a <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> for a particular kind of service (<concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, telnet, etc.).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_621">Then, each time a client within the intranet tries to contact a <concept>SERVER</concept> of that type, the client is actually placed in contact with the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_622">In turn, the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept>, playing the role of a client, contacts the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_623">From then on the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> plays the role of an intermediary between the <concept>ACTUAL CLIENT</concept> and the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> by relaying <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s back and forth.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_624">The first advantage of this arrangement is that the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> has no way of knowing that the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is not the true client, and in fact, it is never aware of the <concept>ACTUAL CLIENT</concept>’s existence.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_625">In turn, the <concept>ACTUAL SERVER</concept> has no way of learning about the intranet’s internal features.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_626">The second advantage is that the <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> is in position to filter all the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s sent from the <concept>SERVER</concept> to the client.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_627">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, an <concept>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> <concept>PROXY SERVER</concept> could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_628">Still another tool for preventing problems in a <concept>NETWORK</concept> environment is auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> that is similar to the auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> we learned about in our discussion on <concept>OPERATING SYSTEM</concept> security (section 3.5).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_629">Using <concept>NETWORK</concept> auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in <concept>MESSAGE</concept> traffic at various locations within the administrator’s realm, monitor the activities of the system’s firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the individual <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s in order to detect irregularities.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_630">In effect, auditing <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> is an administrator’s primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_631">Another means of defense against invasions via <concept>NETWORK</concept> connections is <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> called antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_632">(actually, antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> represents a <concept>BROAD CLASS</concept> of <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_633">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, whereas many products specialize in virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.) it is important for users of these packages to understand that, just as in the case of biological systems, new <concept>COMPUTER</concept> infections are constantly coming on the scene that require updated vaccines.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_634">Thus, antivirus <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> must be routinely maintained by downloading updates from the <concept>SOFTWARE</concept>’s vendor.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_635">Even this, however, does not guarantee the safety of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_636">After all, a new virus must first infect some <concept>COMPUTER</concept>s before it is discovered and a vaccine is produced.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_637">Thus, a wise <concept>COMPUTER</concept> user never opens email attachments from unfamiliar sources, does not download <concept>SOFTWARE</concept> without first confirming its reliability, does not respond to pop-up adds, and does not leave a pc connected to the <concept>INTERNET</concept> when such connection is not necessary.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Encryption</subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_638">In some cases the purpose of <concept>NETWORK</concept> vandalism is to disrupt the system (as in €@<concept class="nested">DENIAL OF <concept>SERVICE ATTACK</concept></concept>#€s), but in other cases the ultimate goal is to gain access to information.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_639">The traditional means of protecting information is to control its access through the use of passwords.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_640">However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over <concept>NETWORK</concept>s and <concept>INTERNET</concept>s where <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are relayed by unknown entities.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_641">In these cases encryption can be used so that even if the data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_642">Today, many <concept>TRADITIONAL INTERNET</concept> applications have been altered to incorporate encryption techniques, producing what are called “secure versions” of the applications.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_643">A prime <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> is the secure version of <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept>, known as https (<concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> over <concept>SECURE SOCKET LAYER</concept>), which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure <concept>INTERNET ACCESS</concept> to their accounts.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_644">The backbone of <concept>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</concept> over <concept>SECURE SOCKET LAYER</concept> is the protocol system known as secure sockets layer (ssl), which was originally developed by netscape to provide secure communication links between web clients and <concept>SERVER</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_645">Most <concept>BROWSER</concept>s indicate the use of secure sockets layer by displaying a tiny padlock icon on the <concept>COMPUTER SCREEN</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_646">(some use the presence or absence of the icon to indicate whether secure sockets layer is being used; others display the padlock in either the locked or unlocked position.) one of the more fascinating topics in the field of encryption is <concept>PUBLICKEY ENCRYPTION</concept>, which involves techniques by which encryption systems are designed so that having knowledge about how <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are encrypted does not allow one to decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_647">This characteristic is somewhat counterintuitive.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_648">After all, intuition would suggest that if a person knows how <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s are encrypted, then that person should be able to reverse the encryption process and thus decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_649">But <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept>s defy this intuitive logic.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_650">A <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept> involves the use of two values called keys.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_651">One key, known as the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, is used to encrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s; the other key, known as the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>, is required to decrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_652">To use the system, the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> is first distributed to those who might need to send <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to a particular destination.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_653">The <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> is held in confidence at this destination.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_654">Then, the originator of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> can encrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> using the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> and send the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> to its destination with assurance that its contents are safe, even if it is handled by intermediaries who also know the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_655">Indeed, the only party that can decrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is the party at the <concept>MESSAGE 'S DESTINATION</concept> who holds the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_656">Thus if bob creates a <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept> and gives both alice and carol the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, then both alice and carol can encrypt <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s to bob, but they cannot spy on the other’s communication.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_657">Indeed, if carol intercepts a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> from alice, she cannot decrypt it even though she knows how alice encrypted it (<concept>FIGURE</concept> 4.16).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_658">There are, of course, subtle problems lurking within public-key systems.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_659">One is to ensure that the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> being used is, in fact, the proper key for the destination party.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_660">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, if you are communicating with your bank, you want to be sure that the <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> you are using for encryption is the one for the bank and not an impostor.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_661">If an impostor presents itself as the bank (an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of spoofing) and gives you its <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>, the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s you encrypt and send to the “bank” would be meaningful to the impostor and not your bank.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_662">Thus, the task of associating <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>s with correct parties is significant.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_663">One approach to resolving this problem is to establish trusted <concept>INTERNET</concept> sites, called certificate authorities, whose task is to maintain accurate lists of parties and their <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_664">These authorities, acting as <concept>SERVER</concept>s, then provide reliable public-key information to their clients in packages known as certificates.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_665">A certificate is a package containing a party’s name and that party’s <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_666">Many commercial certificate authorities are now available on the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, although it is also common for organizations to maintain their own certificate authorities in order to maintain tighter control over the security of the organization’s communication.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_667">Finally, we should comment on the role <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM</concept>s play in solving problems of authentication—making sure that the author of a <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is, in fact, the party it claims to be.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_668">The critical point here is that, in some <concept>PUBLICKEY ENCRYPTION</concept> systems, the roles of the encryption and decryption keys can be reversed.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_669">That is, text can be encrypted with the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept>, and because only one party has access to that key, any text that is so encrypted must have originated from that party.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_670">In this manner, the holder of the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> can produce a <concept>BIT PATTERN</concept>, called a <concept>DIGITAL SIGNATURE</concept>, that only that party knows how to produce.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_671">By attaching that signature to a <concept>MESSAGE</concept>, the sender can mark the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> as being authentic.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_672">A <concept>DIGITAL SIGNATURE</concept> can be as simple as the <concept>ENCRYPTED VERSION</concept> of the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> itself.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_673">All the sender must do is encrypt the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> being transmitted using his or her <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> (the key typically used for decrypting).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_674">When the <concept>MESSAGE</concept> is received, the receiver uses the sender’s <concept>PUBLIC KEY</concept> to decrypt the signature.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_675">The <concept>MESSAGE</concept> that is revealed is guaranteed to be authentic because only the holder of the <concept>PRIVATE KEY</concept> could have produced the <concept>ENCRYPTED VERSION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_676">We will return to the topic of <concept>PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION</concept> at the end of chapter 12, as an <concept>EXAMPLE</concept> of a complex <concept>COMPUTER</concept> algorithm.</sentence></br></br><subsectionTitle>Legal approaches to <concept>NETWORK SECURITY</concept></subsectionTitle></br></br><sentence id="sent_677">Another way of enhancing the security of <concept>COMPUTER</concept> <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing systems is to apply legal remedies.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_678">There are, however, two obstacles to this approach.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_679">The first is that making an action illegal does not preclude the action.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_680">All it does is provide a legal recourse.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_681">The second is that the international nature of <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing means that obtaining recourse is often very difficult.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_682">What is illegal in one country might be legal in another.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_683">Ultimately, enhancing <concept>NETWORK SECURITY</concept> by legal means is an international project, and thus must be handled by international legal bodies—a potential player would be the international court of justice in the hague.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_684">Having made these disclaimers, we must admit that, although less than perfect, legal forces still have a tremendous influence, and thus it behooves us to explore some of the legal steps that are being taken to resolve conflicts in the <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing arena.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_685">For this purpose, we use <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s from the federal laws of the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_686">Similar <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>s could be drawn from other government bodies such as the european union.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_687">We begin with the proliferation of malware.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_688">In the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s this problem is addressed by the <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept>, which was first passed in 1984, although it has been amended several times.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_689">It is under this act that most cases involving the introduction of worms and viruses have been prosecuted.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_690">In short, the act requires proof that the defendant knowingly caused the transmission of a program or data that intentionally caused damage.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_691">The <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept> also covers cases involving the <concept>THEFT OF INFORMATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_692">In particular, the act outlaws obtaining <concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept> via the <concept>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS</concept> of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_693">Courts have tended to assign a broad interpretation to the phrase “<concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept>,” and thus the <concept>COMPUTER FRAUD</concept> and <concept>ABUSE ACT</concept> has been applied to more than the <concept>THEFT OF INFORMATION</concept>.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_694">For instance, courts have ruled that the mere use of a <concept>COMPUTER</concept> might constitute “<concept>ANYTHING OF VALUE</concept>.” the right of privacy is another, and perhaps the most controversial, <concept>NETWORK</concept>ing issue facing the legal community.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_695">Questions involving an employer’s right to monitor the communications of employees and the extent to which an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> is authorized to access the information being communicated by its clients have been given considerable thought.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_696">In the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s, many of these questions are addressed by the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> (ecpa) of 1986, which has its origins in legislation to control wiretapping.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_697">Although the act is lengthy, its intent is captured in a few short excerpts.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_698">In particular, it states that except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept> .</sentence> <sentence id="sent_699">Shall be punished as provided in subsection (4) or shall be subject to suit as provided in subsection (5).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_700">And .</sentence> <sentence id="sent_701">Any person or entity providing an <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept> service to the public shall not intentionally divulge the contents of any communication .</sentence> <sentence id="sent_702">On that service to any person or entity other than an addressee or intended recipient of <concept>SUCH COMMUNICATION</concept> or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_703">In brief, the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> confirms an individual’s right to private communication—it is illegal for an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> to release information about the communication of its clients, and it is illegal for unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop on another’s communication.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_704">But the <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT</concept> leaves room for debate.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_705">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, the question regarding the rights of an employer to monitor the communication of employees becomes a question of authorization, which courts have tended to grant to employers when the communication is carried out using the employer’s equipment.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_706">Moreover, the act goes on to give some government agencies authority to monitor <concept>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</concept>s under certain restrictions.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_707">These provisions have been the source of much debate.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_708">For <concept>EXAMPLE</concept>, in 2000 the fbi revealed the existence of its system, called carnivore, that reports on the communication of all subscribers of an <concept>INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</concept> rather than just a court-designated target, and in 2001 in response to the terrorist attack on the world trade center, congress passed the controversial usa patriot (uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism) act that modified the restrictions under which government agencies must operate.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_709">In 2013, it was subsequently revealed that these laws had been interpreted to authorize the collection of vast amounts of telephone and <concept>INTERNET</concept> usage data on ordinary americans indiscriminately.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_710">In addition to the legal and ethical controversies raised by these developments, providing monitoring rights raises some technical problems that are more pertinent to our study.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_711">One is that to provide these capabilities, a communication system must be constructed and programmed so that communications can be monitored.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_712">To establish such capabilities was the goal of the communications assistance for <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> act (calea).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_713">It requires telecommunication carriers to modify their equipment to accommodate <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> taps—a requirement that has been complex and expensive to meet.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_714">Another controversial issue involves the clash between the government’s right to monitor communications and the public’s right to use encryption.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_715">If the <concept>MESSAGE</concept>s being monitored are well encrypted, then tapping the communication is of limited value to <concept>LAW ENFORCEMENT</concept> agencies.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_716">Governments in the <concept>UNITED STATE</concept>s, canada, and europe are considering systems that would require the registration of ciphering keys, but such demands are being fought by corporations.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_717">After all, due to corporate espionage it is understandable that requiring the registration of ciphering keys would make many law-abiding corporations, as well as citizens, uncomfortable.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_718">How secure can the registration system be? finally, as a means of recognizing the scope of legal issues surrounding the <concept>INTERNET</concept>, we cite the <concept>ANTICYBERSQUATTING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</concept> of 1999 that is designed to protect organizations from impostors who might otherwise establish look-alike <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s (a practice known as cybersquatting).</sentence> <sentence id="sent_719">The act prohibits the use of <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s that are identical or confusingly similar to another’s trademark or “common law trademark.” one effect is that although the act does not outlaw <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> speculation (the process of registering potentially desirable <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s and later selling the rights to that name), it limits the practice to generic <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept>s.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_720">Thus, a <concept>DOMAIN NAME</concept> speculator might legally register a generic name such as greatusedcars.com but might not be able to claim rights to the name bigalusedcars.com if big al is already in the used car business.</sentence> <sentence id="sent_721">Such distinctions are often the subject of debate in lawsuits based on the <concept>ANTICYBERSQUATTING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</concept>.</sentence></section></chapter>
